[{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf is an isometric helicopter shoot 'em up from Electronic Arts. The player is a fighter pilot who must take down mission-critical targets across a number of maps. The player is free to pursue these missions in any order, and must also keep an eye on the fuel, damage, and ammo gauges.<\/p><p>Desert Strike is the first of the prolific <a href=\"\/strike-series\/3025-143\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-143\">Strike<\/a> series, and was followed with <a href=\"\/jungle-strike\/3030-2180\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2180\">Jungle Strike<\/a> and <a href=\"\/urban-strike\/3030-9336\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9336\">Urban Strike<\/a> on the Genesis. Two more games, <a href=\"\/soviet-strike\/3030-2422\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2422\">Soviet Strike<\/a> and <a href=\"\/nuclear-strike\/3030-11731\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11731\">Nuclear Strike<\/a>, were released later for 32-bit systems.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p>A year after the Gulf War, General Ibn Kilbaba takes over a small <a href=\"\/unnamed-middle-eastern-location\/3035-179\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-179\">Arab emirate<\/a> and plans to start World War III. Using an <a href=\"\/ah-64-apache\/3055-2463\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2463\">AH-64 Apache<\/a>, the player must open the way for ground troops and finally take on the \"Madman\" himself.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>The game is played from an isometric perspective in open levels that allow free movement in all directions by scrolling the screen with the movement of the helicopter. Each level consists of many varying objectives that range anywhere from destroying enemy bases and vehicles to capturing enemy troops or rescuing friendly ones. While bases and vehicles are simply destroyed, both friendly and enemy troops must be taken back to base for extraction. The AH-64 Apache has limited cargo space, so multiple trips to and from the base may be necessary. These objectives aren't always linear, and can often be tackled in whatever order the player chooses. This combination of free movement and non-linear structure separated Desert Strike from many of the other contemporary shooters.<\/p><p>There are three weapons of varying strength and usefulness available to the AH-64 Apache: machine guns, hydra missiles, and hellfire missiles, which increase in strength respectively. Each of these weapons has a limited number of ammo which can only be replenished by picking up ammo crates on the mission or by resupplying back at the base. Similarly, the AH-64 Apache only has a limited amount of fuel that will drain slowly over the course of each level. If the fuel runs out, the helicopter crashes and the player loses a life. Refueling works exactly the same as restocking ammo.<\/p><p>Lives are lost when either the AH-64 Apache takes too much damage and is destroyed, or when it runs out of fuel. After three lives have been lost, the game is over. Due to the nature of the game's freedom, each level requires a certain amount of planning and strategy in order to complete all of the objectives while still having enough fuel, ammo, and health to survive.<\/p><h2>Ports<\/h2><p>Due to its popularity on the <a href=\"\/sega-genesis\/3055-4659\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4659\">Sega Genesis<\/a> in 1992, the game was then ported to the <a href=\"\/amiga\/3045-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-1\">Amiga<\/a>, <a href=\"\/sega-master-system\/3045-8\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-8\">Master System<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/snes\/3045-9\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES<\/a> in the same year. Two years later in 1994, it was released on the <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC<\/a>. It was also ported to most handheld systems such as the <a href=\"\/lynx\/3045-7\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-7\">Lynx<\/a> in 1993, <a href=\"\/game-gear\/3045-5\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-5\">Game Gear<\/a> in 1994, <a href=\"\/game-boy\/3045-3\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy<\/a> in 1995, <a href=\"\/game-boy-advance\/3045-4\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance<\/a> in 2002, and finally the <a href=\"\/psp\/3045-18\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP<\/a> in 2006 as part of <a href=\"\/ea-replay\/3030-10965\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10965\">EA Replay<\/a>.<\/p>","id":1,"name":"Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/desert-strike-return-to-the-gulf\/3030-1\/"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6763\/462469-s_dragonslair_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-462469\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.6765625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6763\/462469-s_dragonslair_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-462469\"><img alt=\"Dirk the Daring's fluid animation and unparalleled visual detail helped make Dragon's Lair a hit.\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6763\/462469-s_dragonslair_3.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6763\/462469-s_dragonslair_3.jpg 640w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/6763\/462469-s_dragonslair_3.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6763\/462469-s_dragonslair_3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Dirk the Daring's fluid animation and unparalleled visual detail helped make Dragon's Lair a hit.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Dragon's Lair was first released as a Laserdisc arcade game in 1983 by <a href=\"\/cinematronics\/3010-1479\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1479\">Cinematronics<\/a>, featuring artwork created by former Disney animator <a href=\"\/don-bluth\/3040-45789\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-45789\">Don Bluth<\/a>. Because of the relatively large storage capacity of the laserdisc, Cinematronics were able to create a game that featured higher fidelity graphics than other contemporary games.

The QTE-focused game only appears on certain platforms, in this variation of the game players watch and sometimes control Dirk through his adventures though Singe's castle. At very specific intervals during the game, Dirk will be in a situation that will force the player to control him, choosing which to direction to move him in around or having him attack enemies. Each of these sequences would trigger a new scene in the movie to start playing, similar to the way a DVD can have different \"chapters\" to select at any time. Choosing the right action in these confrontations would cause Dirk to circumnavigate his obstacle with aplomb, while choosing the wrong action would trigger a sequence in which Dirk is killed. The player is helped out by some degree of input clues such as flashing lights letting them know the direction to push. Added help to these sequences was added in the iPhone version which by default causes the on screen controls to flash the correct input, although this feature can be turned of if desired. The limited, simple button pressing gameplay set to cinematic action that would later evolve into the <a href=\"\/quick-time-event\/3015-6\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6\">Quick Time Event<\/a>, featured in games like <a href=\"\/shenmue\/3030-7812\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7812\">Shenmue<\/a>, <a href=\"\/resident-evil-4\/3030-1578\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">Resident Evil 4<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/heavy-rain\/3030-21304\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21304\">Heavy Rain<\/a>.<\/p><p>In the original arcade version, the castle's rooms were presented in a semi-randomized order. The player would advance to a new room regardless of whether they could complete the previous one, however before the final confrontation with the dragon, the player would be required to replay the scenes they failed. In addition many of the rooms played \"in reverse\" (meaning, a jump to the left became a jump to the right the second time a scene played) meaning that even if one were to memorize every room in the castle they would still have to keep a keen eye on the layout of each room. The high score table was usually part of a separate cabinet extension.<\/p><p>An experienced player who memorized every input for every scene could complete the game in less than 10 minutes. These experienced players soon realized that the player's score was increased with every successful input, regardless if the scene ended in success or failure. Thus, the score could be inflated by purposely dying before the last move of a long scene, and saving the last \"life\" for the final scene with the dragon. As new lives were rewarded throughout the game, these players could extend their play time to 20 minutes or more on one credit.<\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><p>Dragon\u2019s Lair was the brain child of <a href=\"\/rick-dyer\/3040-47901\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-47901\">Rick Dyer<\/a>, president of Advanced Microcomputer Systems, who, supposedly, realized that video games needed top quality animation during a viewing of the animated film The Secret of NIMH. He also claims that the Atari 2600 classic \u201cAdventure\u201d was another inspiration for Dragon\u2019s Lair. The entire game was animated by Disney Animator Don Bluth at his personal studio. The game was made in less than 7 months for a mere one million dollars (cheap considering the work they were doing with new technology). The animators on the game couldn\u2019t afford to hire real models to provide an appropriate frame for the Princess Daphne, so Cinematronic\u2019s team apparently used Playboy magazines as an inspiration.<\/p><h2>Xbox Live Arcade Port<\/h2><p>On March 19th, 2012 it was announced that Dragon's Lair was coming to <a href=\"\/xbox-live-marketplace\/3045-86\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-86\">Xbox Live Arcade<\/a>.

He can equip iron fists and iron armor exclusive to him.<\/p><h4>8) Tokio the Ninja<\/h4><p>A speedy ninja, he gains several useful abilities, like a double hit and a power-boosting yell. He can equip the same heavy armor as the Heroes and he is proficient in the use of most weapons; in particular, he's the only character proficient in the use of sabers and bows. (<em>He is different from any of the seven characters in the 7th Saga.<\/em>)<\/p><h2>Arks<\/h2><p>Throughout the game, the player acquires magical objects called Arks. The Arks are like fairies, able to impart their powers onto objects, something the player must do to solve various puzzles in the game. They also represent the scattered power of the Goddess The Arks are:<\/p><h3>Ark of Power<\/h3><p>This Ark is found in the Sand World, in a shrine that can only be reached after the world is flooded. Along with the Ark of Wisdom, the Ark of Power is the only one capable of summoning allies for combat. It can power things that humans cannot, like rusty switches or electrical devices<\/p><h3>Ark of Light<\/h3><p>A group of beetles in the Fruit World have this Ark, and the only way to get it is to beat them. In battle, it imparts lightning properties to whatever it is attached to.<\/p><h3>Ark of Wisdom<\/h3><p>After defeating the Chimera that is terrorizing the Child World, Celia gives this to the party. She uses it to give herself powers far beyond her own abilities. Along with the Ark of Power, the Ark of Wisdom is the only one capable of summon allies for combat. Its wisdom allows unreadable texts to become readable.<\/p><h3>Ark of Fire<\/h3><p>This Ark is found in the Green World, hidden within the underground factory's Hydro Cell. This Ark lights things on fire, obviously. It also gives weapons fiery property.<\/p><h3>Ark of Water<\/h3><p>This Ark is found in the Dark World. It simply fills objects with water.<\/p><h3>Ark of Wood<\/h3><p>This Ark is found in the Wind World, given to the heroes after they destroyed the Ancients.<\/p><h3>Ark of Darkness<\/h3><p>The Darkness gives this to the protagonists after its defeat in the Fairytale World. With it (and the other Arks), they are able to face Black Heart.<\/p><h3> <\/h3><h2>Worlds\/Story<\/h2><h3>Shrine<\/h3><p>A secluded island containing all other worlds, and where the hero's journey begins. Also within this world are figurines of several characters who must be restored to their proper form in their own world. In the back of this shrine is a passage leading to Black Heart, only accessible using the Ark of Darkness.<\/p><h3>Sand World<\/h3><p>The player enters this world through a model ship. Although barren and dry upon entering, by the time the player leaves, it is flooded with water. Two groups of cat pirates, the Bloodhooks and the Gumbos, are waging war, and it is the player's duty to resolve this conflict. This requires working for both factions, taming a large mole monster, and enlisting the help of a cat witch to settle the conflict once and for all.<\/p><h3>Fruit World<\/h3><p>This world is found within a green pumpkin in the Shrine's kitchen, and all the towns in this world are in fruits themselves. The player must rescue the citizens of the Gourd Bridge from mimicking foxes and restore various towns by planting their seeds near a river and watering them. This world's Ark is in the hands of a group of beetles who torment the citizens of Fruit World. However, after being beaten the first time, a crow steals it from a beetle holding the Ark and retreats to a forest in the north. The player gains the Ark of Light after beating a fox who was masquerading as a beetle to gain the Ark for himself.<\/p><h3>Child World<\/h3><p>Entering this world requires using the Ark of Light on a music box in the Shrine's windmill. For a significant amount of time, the player is stuck in a small town called Blind Alley; it is only after they have played with the children that they are able to leave this town. Until the player visits Candy Mountain, there are no monsters to be found, and the entire world is populated almost entirely by children. In fact, the only adult not in the player's party is Celia, a woman who takes care of all the children in a mansion southwest of Blind Alley.<\/p><p>However, after the player restores the mansion's plaza, Celia starts behaving weirdly; she won't let any of the children play outside or speak with any of the heroes. It is up to them to find out what is causing her to act this way. After exploring her secret lab underneath the mansion, the protagonists find out that Celia is actually a witch and that she is the reason why monsters infest the World. She was working with the Chimera, and in exchange for a perfect body, the Chimera's master would rid their world of monsters. Coincidentally, the Chimera reveals that its master is the one able to turn people and objects into figurines.<\/p><h3> <\/h3><h3>Green World<\/h3><p>Found within a clock on the Shrine's second floor, everything in this world is, at first, completely colorless. Thomas Edison lives in a nearby town, but his only his heart remains. The player must bring it back to the shrine, infuse it into Edison's figurine, and bring it back to town. Soon after, the player must acquire gold wine to give to Capone so they can pass through his checkpoint. However, he traps them in a cave because he thinks the wine is fake. After escaping the cave, Capone, confident in the party's abilities, asks them a favor: find his missing daughter. After doing so, he rewards them with gold, alcohol, and permission to pass through the checkpoint.<\/p><p>Upon reaching the top of the mountain Capone was guarding, they discover that the other half of the world has color, but no sound. In nearby Duplo Town, the protagonist finds out that the people all speak sign language, and one of them teaches it to the player so they can speak with everybody in town. Soon, the party finds themselves aiding an artist named Pablo with his work. While helping him, they discover a secret passage that leads to a remote town with both color and sound. Einstein is living here, and he has been working on a machine. Although the precise purpose isn't known, it is know that the machine is broken, and can only be repaired with a certain tree sap. Much to Einstein's chagrin, Edison has put himself in charge of the repairs.<\/p><p>Eventually, Einstein gathers the strength to challenge Edison's role, somehow leading to the repair of the machine. Finally, it is revealed that the machine is an elevator to an underground society\/factory. Many of the people in the town are sick because they all work in the nearby factory. While exploring the factory, it is revealed that the factory is responsible for the lack of color and sound in certain parts of the world. Later, the party finds the Chimera, who then unleashes three knights against them. The heroes are victorious, and upon winning the battle, are rewarded with an upgraded key card. This allows them access to the Hydro Cell area of the factory, which holds the Ark of Fire. When they take it out of its chest, color and sound return to the areas of Green World from which they were absent.<\/p><h3> <\/h3><h3>Wind World<\/h3><p>Upon touching a sand-filled flask in a nearby cave, the hero is warped to an altar in this world. People praying by the altar at the time of their arrival believe him to be their savior, sent to repair their winds. Of course, they'll receive the Ark of Wood upon completion of this task. The task: rescue somebody from a cave. They do so, but upon further exploration of the cave, the group discovers a stone with a message in another language (that they can read with the power of the Ark of Wisdom). It reveals that the wind is generated by a sleeping giant, something the townspeople take hard. The night after this discovery, the giant wakes up, going on rampage and stopping the flow of the wind. On their journey to find the giant, the party travels to the top of a mountain, only to arrive at a nearby town mysteriously. All they know is that a man named Curtis is missing.<\/p><p>However, they find\/rescue him in a nearby tower. He was studying the artifacts in the tower when a monster attacked him. When the party finds two books at the bottom of the tower, they bring them back to Curtis for him to translate. One of the books mentions a mirror that seals away magic hidden somewhere in the sands of the world. The group finds it in a nearby cave and, upon retrieving it, show it to Curtis. He speaks of its uses, and the party then travels to a nearby factory. Inside is a clone, who they are able to beat with the help of the mirror. However, after the battle, the mirror breaks. Upon further exploration of the factory, they find the switch that shuts down all the machinery. After turning the machines off, Curtis relays to them the message of the Black Book: that there is a race of Ancients still living, and that the Giant is actually one of their creations.<\/p><p>The book also allows them entrance to a nearby tower which helps them stop the Ancients from polluting the world. At the top of the tower is a device which seems to control the Giant. When activated, the Giant knocks down the tower, turning it into a bridge to a nearby island. On the island is an underground cloning facility full of Ancients. After fighting through the relatively few awake Ancients, the group meets Kuga, leader of the Ancients. He not only plans to pollute the skies, but to eliminate light from the world. After his defeat, the Ancients are no more, the Giant sinks into the ocean, and wind returns to the world. As thanks, the people give him the Ark of Wood.<\/p><h3> <\/h3><h3>Dark World<\/h3><p>Only the hero is allowed to enter this world (through a painting in the Shrine), and once they enter, they cannot leave until they complete the world. Through diaries scattered throughout the world, the hero learns that others have entered this world, but were driven to madness by being trapped in it. Since the Hero is the only (visible) character in this world, there is little story to it; the Dark World is a confusing mess of puzzles and brain-teasers. The Ark of Water is found here. However, after finding it, the Darkness escapes from the world with the hero and reveals that it grew up there, writing the entries in the diaries and slowly becoming insane.<\/p><h3> <\/h3><h3>Fairytale World<\/h3><p>This world is populated by many famous characters from fairy tales, including Hansel &amp; Gretel, Cinderella, and the Big Bad Wolf. In fact, the King is looking for people to hunt down the Big Bad Wolf. But while hiring the protagonists to do just that, a woman interrupts the King to inform him that Little Red Riding Hood and her grandma have been captured by the wolf. With the help of Geppetto, the group reaches the Big Bad Wolf, defeats him, and rescues the girls. Oddly enough, Little Red Riding Hood reveals that the Big Bad Wolf inadvertently saved her from the Darkness.<\/p><p>When they return to tell the King of their exploits, a little girl interrupts the King (again) and tells him that the Goblin of Kuru Forest has been terrorizing Tinkle Town again. Again, the King asks the hero to take care of the problem. In the Kuru Forest, they discover that the Goblin was actually a cowardly lion lion. He is searching for a tower in the forest because he heard a wizard in the tower will grant him courage, but finds out that he's in the wrong forest. When the heroes tell this to the King, he allows them audience with the wizard, a recluse who can grant them any wish they desire. However, the wizard reveals that the Darkness stole his powers, and that it is a threat the King should not take lightly. In addition, he reveals that Gretel knows where the Darkness is.<\/p><p>She reveals that it is in the waterfall to the south of Tinkle Town, and that they need an invisibility cloak to reach it. However, the only tailor capable of making such a cloak is nowhere to be found, mainly because he sends the group on a pointless fetch quest without them knowing it. Once they reveal that the King sent them, he's happy to oblige, under one condition: that the heroes give Cinderella a dress for the upcoming ball. They also give her glass slippers they received from a shoe-bearing tree. Everything occurs according to the original story until the Darkness turns several people into figurines, and captures the rest, taking them to the aforementioned waterfall.<\/p><p>On their way to rescue the people of Tinkle Town, a Keaton Fox appears and challenges them to a fight. After beating him, they must face a Water Dragon, and then, finally, the Darkness. After its defeat, the Darkness reveals that those who faced it in the past became its slaves. Being the only people to have beaten it, the Darkness gives them the Ark of Darkness.<\/p><h4> <\/h4><h4>Mini Game World<\/h4><p>A secret world only accessible through a tree behind the Shrine, the only things here are two card-flipping mini games; one of them involves flipping cards until the player hits the demon card, another is a simple card matching game. Both of these games garner prizes depending on the player's performance.<\/p><h3>Arena<\/h3><p>This world is contained within an immovable sword on the beach behind the Shrine. Here, the player can trade in monsters for special items, bet on monsters in fights (much like <a href=\"\/dragon-warrior-iii\/3030-16848\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16848\">Dragon Quest III<\/a>), or pit the monsters the player owns in combat.<\/p><h2>Fan Translation<\/h2><p>Since this game was never released outside of Japan, there has never been an official translation or localization. Due to the complexity of rewriting this game's script and hacking it back in, the fan translation took 10 years to complete, making this one of the last SNES-era RPGs to receive a translation. It was finally released in 2010; oddly enough, a second - completely different translation from a different group was released mere weeks later.<\/p>","id":168,"name":"Mystic Ark","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/mystic-ark\/3030-168\/"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4910\/271782-guardian.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-271782\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.98666666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4910\/271782-guardian.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-271782\"><img alt=\"The Guardian appears to the Avatar.\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4910\/271782-guardian.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4910\/271782-guardian.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"><\/a><figcaption>The Guardian appears to the Avatar.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Ultima VII is a top down, Western style role playing game for the PC with a real-time combat system. Released in 1992, Ultima VII is set in the mythical realm of <a href=\"\/britannia\/3035-416\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-416\">Britannia <\/a>and features the hero character of the series known as <a href=\"\/avatar\/3005-2025\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2025\">The Avatar<\/a>. The story takes the Avatar back to Britannia, where 200 years have passed since the events of the previous game, <a href=\"\/ultima-vi-the-false-prophet\/3030-10012\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10012\">Ultima VI: The False Prophet<\/a>.<\/p><p>The game was also ported to the Super Nintendo (in 1994) and Mac. The SNES version saw both US and Japan releases. Ultima VII: The Black Gate ends of a cliffhanger that is resolved in <a href=\"\/ultima-vii-part-two-serpent-isle\/3030-8878\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8878\">Ultima VII Part 2: Serpent Isle<\/a>. It also received an expansion disk named <a href=\"\/ultima-vii-the-forge-of-virtue\/3030-1347\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1347\">Forge of Virtue<\/a>. Ultima VII and its sequel and expansions were also included in numerous Ultima compilations.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p>After being contacted through his computer by a mysterious red entity, the Avatar enters the moongate in his backyard and travels through the gate from Earth to Britannia. He finds himself in the town of Trinsic, where a gruesome double murder has taken place. In the process of uncovering the clues towards solving the murders, the Avatar first comes in contact with The Fellowship, a new philosophical organization founded by a druid named <a href=\"\/batlin\/3005-3310\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3310\">Batlin<\/a>. The Fellowship follow a new doctrine which conflicts with the Eight Virtues enshrined by <a href=\"\/lord-british\/3005-1401\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1401\">Lord British<\/a>, but make a great deal of how they have improved the lives of Britannia's citizens. After leaving Trinsic, the Avatar discovers that the magic users of the world are going crazy, and that the strange material blackrock is somehow connected to it. By following the trail of two of The Fellowship's leaders, the Avatar uncovers the true origins and purpose of the group. After foiling the attempt of the Guardian to invade through the Black Gate, the Avatar finds himself trapped in Britannia and unable to return to Earth.<\/p><p>The Black Gate is the first installment of \"The Age of Apocalypse,\" the final story arc of the main Ultima series. It strikes a darker tone than its predecessors, which becomes apparent when one of the first things the player encounters is a blood-soaked, grisly murder scene. Corruption -- in both political and spiritual forms -- is one of the game's major themes.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4910\/272034-u7inv.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-272034\" data-size=\"large\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4910\/272034-u7inv.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-272034\"><img alt=\"inventory system\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4910\/272034-u7inv.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4910\/272034-u7inv.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>inventory system<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Ultima VII features a sophisticated skill and inventory system that allows the player to develop the character in ways that match their playing style. Along the way, the Avatar will meet new NPCs, and old friends from past games who they can invite into their party. While Ultima VII was not the first game in the series to feature mouse support, it was the first to feature a \"point and click\" user interface as its preferred form of input.<\/p><p>An expansion pack <a href=\"\/ultima-vii-the-forge-of-virtue\/3030-1347\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1347\">Ultima VII: The Forge of Virtue<\/a> was released in 1992.

Like Ultima VI before it, the game included several veiled jabs at EA, as Origin had a tumultuous relationship with the publisher even before the takeover. In the game, the evil Guardian uses three Blackrock Generators to disrupt magic throughout Britannia and broadcast his insidious messages into the minds of its populace. The three generators were built in the shape of a cube, a sphere and a tetrahedron, matching the appearance of the original <a href=\"\/electronic-arts\/3010-1\/all-images\/52-201475\/electronic_arts\/51-1777475\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1\">Electronic Arts logo<\/a>.<\/p><p>The Super Nintendo port of Ultima VII was severely shortened and simplified, leaving out many of the game's darker elements.<\/p><h2>Exult<\/h2><p>As Ultima VII is DOS game that is unable to play correctly on Windows XP and beyond, the fan community created a program that allows users to play it on those operating systems. Exult is an emulator designed to allow people who own legitimate copies of Ultima VII to play it on modern operating systems. Development was originally started by Jeff Freedman specifically for the X Window System, hence Ex-Ult. Since it's original development it has been ported across a number of platforms from Windows PCs to Pocket PCs, Linux and OSX.<\/p><p>Exult allows players to play through both the original Ultima VII: The Black Gate (with The Forge of Virtue add on) and the sequel Ultima VII: Serpent Isle (with The Silver Seed add on) campaigns. The developers not only allowed players to relive the experience of Ultima VII but also allowed for changes and tweaks to be added to the game and its interfaces.<\/p><p>One minor interface change that was added to a version of Exult was to give players the option to use the \"Paperdoll\" inventory system from Serpent Isle in Black Gate. A more recent and larger change was added in the form of craftable items and extra quests. While this required the player download various hacked data files it provided an extension of the original gameplay.<\/p><p>While the Exult project has no official support from EA (the current owners of the Ultima franchise) developers of the original game have shown their support, most notably Richard Garriott, who in a letter to the Exult team wrote:<\/p><blockquote><p>\" Just so that you know.

Each fighter has their own <a href=\"\/health\/3015-130\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-130\">life bar<\/a>, which depletes after each successful attack. The winner of the round is decided after either the game's <a href=\"\/countdown-timer\/3015-1061\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1061\">countdown timer<\/a> expires or one of the fighters is <a href=\"\/knock-out\/3015-313\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-313\">\"knocked out\"<\/a> (by emptying their life bar).<\/p><p>Typically a match is won by winning two out of three rounds, but a <a href=\"\/double-knock-out\/3015-1768\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1768\">Double KO<\/a> (in which both players are knocked out simultaneously) or a <a href=\"\/draw\/3015-621\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-621\">Draw Game<\/a> (when the game's timer expires and both players having equal vitality remaining) extends the match for another round (while no victor is declared). If the match extends to ten total rounds (four total rounds in the game's updates) and no winner is declared, then both players lose the match.<\/p><p>When players are facing off against computer opponents, they must progress through each opponent throughout the game and defeat them. Losing a match allows players to <a href=\"\/continue\/3015-635\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-635\">continue<\/a>, in which players can pick a different fighter (if desired) and restart the fight. If a player manages to defeat all seven opponents, he must face three Grand Masters: American former professional <a href=\"\/boxer\/3015-13\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-13\">boxer<\/a> <a href=\"\/balrog\/3005-61\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-61\">Balrog<\/a>, Spanish cage fighter <a href=\"\/vega\/3005-30\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-30\">Vega<\/a>, and the master of Muay Thai, <a href=\"\/sagat\/3005-102\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-102\">Sagat<\/a> (the final boss from the previous game). It is revealed after defeating Sagat that the player must fight the mysterious dictator <a href=\"\/m-bison\/3005-185\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-185\">M. Bison<\/a> to win the tournament. Each of the eight playable fighters have unique endings showing the aftermath of their battle with M. Bison.<\/p><p>Fights between players and CPU opponents can be interrupted by another player (causing the message \"HERE COMES A NEW CHALLENGER!\" to appear), which triggers a new one-on-one match between the two players in which the winner moves on to fight the current CPU opponent.<\/p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Controls<\/h3><p>Like the basic version of the original Street Fighter, players have a eight-directional joystick (used for movement) and six buttons in a horizontal rectangular formation (used for attacking). Each of the six buttons corresponds to a different attack type (three \"Punch\" attacks and three \"Kick\" attacks) and strength\/speed (two Light attacks, two Medium attacks, and two Heavy attacks). Light attacks are safer to perform (despite dealing less damage) while Heavy attacks deal powerful damage (despite leaving the fighter in a vulnerable state if the attack misses).<\/p><p>While walking in one of two directions by holding the joystick in one of two positions (Back for walking away from their opponent and Forward for walking towards their opponent), players can <a href=\"\/crouching\/3015-378\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-378\">crouch<\/a> down by holding the joystick in one of the three downward positions (Down, Down-Back, and Down-Forward) and jump up by tapping the joystick in one of the three upward positions (Up for jumping up, Up-Back for jumping away from their opponent, and Up-Forward for jumping towards their opponent). Certain attacks miss when their ducked under or jumped over, while these maneuvers also give new attack options (such as, for crouching players, an anti-air <a href=\"\/uppercut\/3015-1128\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1128\">uppercut<\/a> and a <a href=\"\/sweep-kick\/3015-3119\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3119\">leg sweep<\/a> capable of knocking down opponents).<\/p><p>Players who are hit with multiple attacks in quick succession have a high chance of becoming <a href=\"\/stun\/3015-1577\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1577\">\"dizzied\"<\/a>. Visualized by a halo of stars around the fighter's head, dizzied opponents are stunned and cannot move or attack until they either receive another hit or \"break out\" of their dizzy state (by tapping multiple buttons and moving the joystick around).<\/p><h4>Advanced Abilities<\/h4><p>Using the joystick, players can also perform <a href=\"\/blocking\/3015-1843\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1843\">blocks<\/a> (known in Japanese version as \"guards\") by holding the joystick in either the Back position (for standing blocks) or Down-Back position (for crouching blocks). Blocked players receive no damage or knockback\/knockdown from normal attacks, but are more vulnerable to Grab Attacks (which throw the opponent in a desired direction, damaging them in the process). Grabs are performed by holding either Back or Forward on the joystick (the direction choosing which way to throw the opponent) and pressing Medium Punch or Heavy Punch while the opponent is very close and not jumping.<\/p><p>Along with a variety of normal attacks (some of which are different depending on how close the opponent is), each fighter has a set of secret <a href=\"\/special-attacks\/3015-327\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-327\">\"special moves\"<\/a> performed by specific joystick and button combinations. These techniques have special abilities (such as throwing a projectile across the screen or hurling the fighters at their opponents) and can deal more damage (even slightly damaging blocked opponents, later known as <a href=\"\/chip-damage\/3015-2474\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2474\">\"chip damage\"<\/a>).<\/p><p>Originally determined as a bug, players can \"cancel\" attack animations into other attacks, allowing players to chain several attacks and special moves into a <a href=\"\/combo\/3015-18\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-18\">\"combo\"<\/a>. This technique was soon adapted as a standard feature of the fighting game franchise and was expanded throughout the Street Fighter series.<\/p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Bonus Stages<\/h3><figure style=\"width: 384px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/73970\/1495552-0039.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1495552\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.58333333333333\" data-width=\"384\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/73970\/1495552-0039.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1495552\"><img alt=\"Ryu destroys a car with his bare hands (and feet).\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/73970\/1495552-0039.png\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/73970\/1495552-0039.png 384w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/73970\/1495552-0039.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ryu destroys a car with his bare hands (and feet).\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/73970\/1495552-0039.png\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/73970\/1495552-0039.png 384w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/73970\/1495552-0039.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Ryu destroys a car with his bare hands (and feet).<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After defeating every three CPU opponents, players participate in a <a href=\"\/bonus-stage\/3015-646\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-646\">bonus stage<\/a> for additional score.

Unaware of this conflict and his family's ties to it, <a href=\"\/cless-alvein\/3005-2787\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2787\">Cless Alvein<\/a> lives a simple life in the village of Toltus as a hunter of local game and apprentice to his father, Alvein Sword Style Master Miguel Alvein. He sets off on an ordinary hunt alongside his childhood friend, <a href=\"\/chester-burklight\/3005-3132\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3132\">Chester Barklight<\/a>, but is soon sent racing back by the sound of the village's warning bell. Thunder began to roll as a horrifying sight greeted them: the villagers had all been slaughtered, including Miguel and Maria Alvein and Chester's little sister Ami. His mother's dying words pleaded Cless to flee with the pendant he had been entrusted with before the marauders returned. Though initially only set on revenge against the ones responsible, the two would find themselves thrust into a complex conflict spanning time and space.<\/p><h2>Characters<\/h2><p><a href=\"\/cless-alvein\/3005-2787\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2787\"><b>Cless Alvein<\/b><\/a> - The prototypical swordsman and first line of defense for the party, Cless is a skilled and resourceful fighter, able to incorporate swords, axes and spears along with shields into his techniques. He is upright and disciplined, often looking out for others, but he can be a little naive. Though not dense by any means, Cless tends to comically fumble his way through dungeons and puzzles. He also has a love of horrible puns and wordplay. When it comes to Dhaos, however, his hatred borders on fanaticism.<\/p><p><b><a href=\"\/chester-burklight\/3005-3132\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3132\">Chester Barklight<\/a><\/b> - Chester is the Legolas to Cless's Aragorn, dishing out pain from afar with his trusty bow. Although hotheaded and bitter over his loss, he sees the need to be upbeat when Cless can't be. He doesn't think twice about putting himself in harm's way for his friend, who he feels is far more capable than himself. Chester tries not to sweat the small stuff too much. His aim and drive to improve are second to none.<\/p><p><a href=\"\/mint-adnade\/3005-4938\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4938\"><b>Mint Adnade<\/b><\/a> - Cless finds Mint trapped in Euclid's prison when he himself is captured by the \"Man in Black Armor.\" He comes to find she's also related to one of the four heroes and was holding a similar pendant before it was stolen. Mint is the healer of the group and a faithful priestess. Her only offensive spells are debuffs and 'Pikohan', strange toy hammers that fall from the sky and stun enemies. Although she's very proper and ladylike, Mint can also be romantic and impulsive when it comes to subjects like love and matchmaking and isn't afraid to express her opinion. She has a love of piano and plays proficiently.<\/p><p><a href=\"\/claus-f-lester\/3005-10537\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10537\"><b>Klarth F. Lester<\/b><\/a> - Cless and Mint meet Klarth 100 years in the past in a substantially quieter Euclid Village. He has been researching ways in which humans could use magic like elves and half-elves do with his partner, Mirald. It's Mirald who finally convinces Klarth to go along with the two without payment, as their goals are basically the same: the party needs magic to combat Dhaos and Klarth needs to travel to form pacts with Summons through the use of rare Pact Rings. He can be selfish and crude at times, but his knowledge, wisdom and Summons make him invaluable. His pinup collection is infamous.<\/p><p><a href=\"\/arche-klein\/3005-4138\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4138\"><b>Arche Klaine<\/b><\/a> - Arche is a mischievous half-elf who rides a broom and casts spells that make enemies go boom. Once her identity is revealed, her father Bart of Lone Valley gives her permission to journey with the group and use her magic to take down Dhaos. Arche is bright and cheery and even a little boy crazy, but she shows moments of weakness and frustration when it comes to the poor treatment of half-elves and her missing Elven mother. Her cooking can be fatal.<\/p><p><a href=\"\/suzu-fujibayashi\/3005-10536\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10536\"><b>Suzu Fujibayashi<\/b><\/a> - This little <a href=\"\/kunoichi\/3015-4596\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4596\"><b>kunoichi<\/b><\/a> (female ninja) hails from the mysterious hidden Ninja Village.

Using skills or casting spells costs the character TP, or Technical Points, which can be replenished with items, food, sleeping, or slightly when a battle ends.

The unnamed player character is first presented with the option to build a robot in the hometown of Rococo, with each additional robot (up to three) costing a set amount more than the previous robot. These robots are built and customized in R&amp;D stations scattered around the game world. Robots can also be customized upon leveling up, but creation can only occur at R&amp;D stations.<\/p><p>Upon creation, robots are allotted a certain amount of energy points, which can be freely distributed into five stats: health, strength, defense, charge (the speed at which attacking ability is recharged), and speed. Even after allotting these points, they can be freely moved at any time, and subsequently distributed into another statistic. Additionally, robots' color is also customizable, with sliders for red, green, and blue (and any mixture therein).<\/p><p>The last part of customizability involves \"programming\" special attacks that the robots can unleash during battle. Every special attack in the game is available from the outset, the player merely has to know the combination of buttons to program it. In order to program a move, the player inputs the right trigger, left trigger, and X button in a particular order. For example, the right trigger three times will be a triple sword hit.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3948\/956532-gfs_40365_2_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-956532\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3948\/956532-gfs_40365_2_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-956532\"><img alt=\"R&amp;D Stations are where players can create and customize robots.\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3948\/956532-gfs_40365_2_3.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3948\/956532-gfs_40365_2_3.jpg 640w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3948\/956532-gfs_40365_2_3.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3948\/956532-gfs_40365_2_3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>R&amp;D Stations are where players can create and customize robots.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The battle system is somewhat similar to the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-95\" href=\"\/active-time-battle\/3015-95\/\" slug=\"active-time-battle\">Active Time Battle<\/a> system used in many <a data-ref-id=\"3025-194\" href=\"\/final-fantasy\/3025-194\/\" slug=\"final-fantasy\">Final Fantasy<\/a> games. Battles take place on a three plane field, where the player and enemies can move up and down into each row. After activating a battle, there are two time-based actions that occur. The player is given a time limit, and if this limit is met then extra experience is awarded. Secondly, there are treasure chests scattered in the battle field, which, when broken by specific weapons, award items.<\/p><p>Each weapon (up to three can be equipped simultaneously) is mapped to a separate button. The left trigger controls a long range weapon (typically a shot or laser), the right trigger controls the melee weapon (typically a sword, blade, axe, etc.), and the X button controls the bomb (if equipped, as stat boosting packs can be equipped here instead). Robots are also able to Run programs, use items, change which robot is active, or escape the battle. Each action takes a certain amount of energy, and as energy is recharging, enemies are able to attack. The speed at which energy recharges is controlled by the charge stat.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3948\/956543-robotrek12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-956543\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87404580152672\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3948\/956543-robotrek12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-956543\"><img alt=\"The overworld map system is akin to Super Mario Bros. 3.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px\" data-width=\"262\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3948\/956543-robotrek12.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3948\/956543-robotrek12.jpg 262w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The overworld map system is akin to Super Mario Bros. 3.\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3948\/956543-robotrek12.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3948\/956543-robotrek12.jpg 262w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px\" data-width=\"262\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The overworld map system is akin to Super Mario Bros. 3.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The overworld is separated into two different parts; the main overworld, which is akin to the level selection from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10299\" href=\"\/super-mario-bros-3\/3030-10299\/\" slug=\"super-mario-bros-3\">Super Mario Bros. 3<\/a>, and then more specific areas such as towns or caves (each dot on the map leads to an area). In the more specific areas, the player is able to use key items, typically for a story driven purpose (such as a drill which can destroy rocks in caves, or glasses which allow the player to see invisible enemies and traps).<\/p><p>Books are an integral part of learning new building parts. The player is able to craft and combine items within the R&amp;D stations. Many \"crafting recipes\" are gained from reading books, known in the context of the game as \"Inventor's Friends.\" Each book has a level requirement, and some can even be missed entirely. Crafting items does cost money, whereas combining items does not. Combining items can also be used to level up weapons. For example, combining two Sword 4s will result in a Sword 4 at level 2. These levels go up to nine.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><p>Robotrek follows an unnamed protagonist on his quest to become a more skilled inventor.

Imprisoned long ago by the Gods of Vecanti, he now possesses the Titan Ring, an item that gives him almost insurmountable power. He hates his father and was jealous of his father's power when younger. He is responsible for the death of Am, as she takes an attack intended for Valna. In both versions of the game he is fought in the core of Red Moon, although he has multiple forms in the PCE version. He challenges his father in his normal form, then he fights Lena in a powered-up form and eventually turns in to a giant disembodied head and set of hands which are fought in a field of stars. In the SFC version, he simply remains in his normal form (although he does fire some bullets at Lena from the comfort of his throne before actually attacking!)<\/p><h2>The Super Famicom\/SNES version<\/h2><p>In the SFC version of the game, only Lena Bland is playable. She is capable of several basic actions, including running, jumping, and attacking. She can also shoot magic bullets (the player holds \"up\" and attacks to fire these.) There are a number of items in this game. Up to six can be held in reserves; if another item is picked up, it replaces the item furthest to the left of the item bar and moves all the remaining items to the left by one space, appearing on the far right. At the end of the game, Yuko appears to judge the player's performance based on a variety of criteria.<\/p><h3>Items<\/h3><ul><li>Heart: A single use item. This heals some lost energy when used.<\/li><li>Armor: A single use item. When this is used, Lena transforms and wears Valis armor. This makes her immune to damage for five hits, after which she returns to normal.<\/li><li>Three way: This item replaces Lena's basic magic bullet when used. This allows Lena to shoot three beams up at various angles by perform the normal motion for the magic bullet. This item can be used 20 times before it wears off.<\/li><li>Bomber: This item replaces Lena's magic bullet when used. Bomber shoots a powerful blast straight forward. This item can be used 10 times before wearing off.<\/li><li>Search: This item also replaces Lena's magic bullet when used. Re-using the \"wolf head\" sprites of Asfar's attack from the PCE version, Lena fires wolf-heads that follow the terrain (they move up hills, etc.) This item can be used 20 times before expiring.<\/li><li>Homing: Again, this replaces Lena's basic magic bullet. Lena fires flaming dragons that home in on enemies. This item can be used 20 times before expiring.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Stages<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/44493\/1061566-ds30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1061566\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4184397163121\" data-width=\"141\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 141px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/44493\/1061566-ds30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1061566\"><img alt=\"The DS-30 custom!\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 141px) 100vw, 141px\" data-width=\"141\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/44493\/1061566-ds30.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/44493\/1061566-ds30.jpg 141w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The DS-30 custom!\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/44493\/1061566-ds30.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/44493\/1061566-ds30.jpg 141w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 141px) 100vw, 141px\" data-width=\"141\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The DS-30 custom!<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The SFC\/SNES version of the game has seven stages, or \"acts\".<\/p><ul><li>Stage 1: Vecanti<\/li><\/ul><p>Vecanti is in ruination from Galgia's overwhelming attacks. The boss of this stage is DS-30kai. It is also a boss in the PCE version, although of a much later stage, and its actions are completely different. The enemies in this stage are: deadhead, flying shears, and lance guarder.<\/p><ul><li>Stage 2: Vanity Castle<\/li><\/ul><p>Once the seat of Queen Valia's power, it has a tendency to be taken over by villains. Currently it is occupied by General Dhalgen. The enemies in this stage are: dead head, lance guarder G, and spectre.<\/p><ul><li>Stage 3: Babylon<\/li><\/ul><p>Water and ruins abound on Lena's journey to see Yuko. The boss of this stage is Nornil, a shape-shifting statue with three forms (a statue, a harpy, and a mermaid.) This boss is unique to the SFC version of the game, although the harpy sprite is also used in the PCE version for a different boss. The enemies in this stage are: okimono, lash, and technical monkey.<\/p><ul><li>Stage 4: Valhalla<\/li><\/ul><p>Yuko's dominion. General Medius is in control of this area in the SFC version. In this game, Medius attacks by creating multiple fake images of herself and diving rapidly at Lena. Occasionally she drops to the platform to fire a large orange projectile or two at Lena. The enemies in this stage are: seraph, death flower, high priestess, siren, and arch elf.<\/p><ul><li>Stage 5: Crystal Pillar<\/li><\/ul><p>Formerly King Galgia's prison, it is now his base of operations on Earth. The boss of this stage is the core of Crystal Pillar, and is unique to the SFC version. It is protected by \"Final Guarder\", which is also an enemy from the PCE version's final stage. This version of \"Final Guarder\" is invincible, the core must be targeted. The enemies in this stage are: sword guarder, tower grey, disc guarder.<\/p><ul><li><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/44493\/1061567-jetstream.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1061567\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.71090047393365\" data-width=\"211\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 211px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.1%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/44493\/1061567-jetstream.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1061567\"><img alt=\"Look out, it's the Jet Stream Crush!\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px\" data-width=\"211\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/44493\/1061567-jetstream.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/44493\/1061567-jetstream.jpg 211w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Look out, it's the Jet Stream Crush!\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/44493\/1061567-jetstream.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/44493\/1061567-jetstream.jpg 211w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px\" data-width=\"211\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Look out, it's the Jet Stream Crush!<\/figcaption><\/figure> Stage 6: The surface of Red Moon<\/li><\/ul><p>Floating foetuses and strange copies of Lena abound.

There are also a number of gameplay differences. The game moves at a much slower pace, and Lena is capable of some actions not present in the SFC version: she can slide and has powerful magic (in fact, each character has magic). However, she is incapable of running and does not have the magic bullet and power ups from the SFC version. Her sword strikes shoot crescent arcs when performed, unlike in the SFC version. The game also has multiple playable characters: By hitting the \"run\" button, the player can switch between Lena, Am, or Asfar. Lastly, the game's stages are quite different, despite some of them using the same or similar sprites. There are also different power ups to be collected.

Asfar rescues Lena and Am from Galgia at the end of the previous stage, and now joins as a playable character. A number of enemies not present in the SFC version are found in this stage, including a version of lash weilding a flaming whip (probably how it got the name) a cyclops, and a floating energy ball (which does make an appearances in the SFC version, albeit recoloured orange as an attack of General Medius'). The boss of this stage is a disembodied head and pair of hands not found in the SFC version.<\/p><ul><li>Stage 3: Road to the heavens<\/li><\/ul><p>Continuing to the heavens to meet Yuko, this stage continues with the look of \"Babylon\". The boss of this stage is a pegasus knight who transforms in to a harpy for a second form. The harpy sprite is re-used in the SFC version as Nornil's second form.<\/p><ul><li>Stage 4: Labyrinth of Shiren<\/li><\/ul><p>Material from this stage is used for \"Valhalla\" in the SFC version. An enemy not in the SFC version is present (a pixie.) The boss is a pair of illusions created by Yuko; one of her goddess self, and one of her old \"Soldier of Valis\" self.<\/p><ul><li>Stage 5: Tokyo<\/li><\/ul><p>The city streets are burning and overrun with monsters from Galgia's army. Freak weather conditions are also apparent. Features a couple of enemies not seen in the SFC version, including a giant worm, a \"tower red\" and an enhanced version of the spectre. The boss of this stage is DS-30kai. It is substantially more difficult in this game. Unlike in the SFC version where it simply throws scythe blades and floats around, in the PCE version it creates multiple images of itself, teleports, fires skull projectiles and (of course) throws scythe blades and dives at Lena.<\/p><ul><li>Stage 6: Inside Crystal Pillar<\/li><\/ul><p>The SFC version looks much the same. This marks the first appearance of the annoying foetus \"beyond\" in this version of the game. There is yet another variation of the spectre seen in this stage, and a skull ghost that appears in pits to fire projectiles at our heroes. Unlike in the later SFC version, some parts of this stage are \"slippery\"; because Asfar is so heavy, he doesn't slide around like the girls do. General Medius is the boss of this stage. She flies around the room and teleports periodically; she also fires blue foetuses,destructable blue crystals, and an orange projectile that bounces around the screen at the player.<\/p><ul><li>Stage 7: Exterior of Crystal Pillar<\/li><\/ul><p>The heroes must climb the outside of Crystal Pillar to reach the summit. There are a large number of enemies not present in the SFC version in this stage, including dark angels, \"gun guarders\", and small rods of crystal that open and shoot projectiles. Once again the floors are slippery, and once again Asfar is not affected. There are also special barriers in this stage that Asfar can walk through, as he is a member of the monster race. The stage also features glowing platforms that are only visible part of the time (although they still \"exist\" even when not visible). Gojira makes a cameo appearance in the background of this stage. The boss of this stage is General Luzard. He simply floats back and forth, firing crystal spikes at the player. The player character Am is lost in this stage.<\/p><ul><li>Stage 8: Red Moon<\/li><\/ul><p>The original version of Red Moon is extremely different from the SFC version. There are a variety of floor types here that move the player character around in different directions, or are simply slippery; Asfar is not affected by these. There are \"turret\" type enemies that are brains here, not seen in the SFC version. Asfar challenges his son to a duel at the end; most of Galgia's attacks here mimic his father's magic.<\/p><ul><li>Stage 9: Red Moon part 2<\/li><\/ul><p>More of the same, except now only Lena is playable. This stage features a couple of mini-bosses. The first is \"final guarder\", who is destructable in this game (unlike in the SFC version) and the second is a giant, cyclopean brain that fires eyeballs. The foetus bubbles make another appearance, this time reducing Lena's level if they make contact and pop. At the end of the stage, Lena finally fights Galgia. His first form hovers and fires small homing \"wolf heads\" at Lena; he also drops to the ground and performs clawing attacks (especially if the player has been sliding back and forth under him frequently). His second form is a giant disembodied head and pair of hands. The hands can be destroyed and drop big herbs. The head flies around shooting various projectiles at Lena. From time to time it becomes invincible and careens around wildly. The head has a very large amount of HP. Should the player defeat Galgia, they are rewarded with the (rather gloomy) ending cutscene.<\/p><h2>Secrets<\/h2><p>The PCE Engine version of Valis IV has two secret stages, both labeled \"X\" that can be accessed if the game is set to the highest difficulty and the player defeats Galgia, or via using a stage select code: Up, down, left, right, up, down, left, right, up, down, left, right, II, II, I, I.<\/p><p>One of the stages is a rather bizarre railway, featuring enemies from other parts of the game on handcars, mine carts, and other silly obstacles. The boss is Zalude from Valis III. He refuses to fight Asfar or Am, resulting in bizarre dialogue from him (he wonders where Cham and Valna are) and a game reset! If he is fought and defeated with Lena Bland, he will send her to stage 5 of the PC Engine version of Valis III. It is extremely difficult and is heavily populated with enemies from other parts of Valis IV. The boss is Zalude again, although he is incredibly difficult this time, utilizing many attacks which are essentially impossible to avoid.<\/p>","id":442,"name":"Valis IV","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/valis-iv\/3030-442\/"},{"description":"<div><h2>Story<\/h2><\/div>Incantation is a game with an incredibly simple story: Play as a young boy wizard to defeat some evil.\u00a0<div><br\/><\/div><div><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><\/div><div>The game is an action side-scroller set in a medieval fantasy world.

The camera angle for the game is isometric and top-down. Because the angles are diagonal, players move towards the top right of the screen as opposed to moving forwards or upwards as with traditional football games. The game features three different modes of gameplay: High School, College, and NFL. Each mode features a quick play option for both 1-2 players, but College and NFL has season long modes as well.<\/p><h3>High School<\/h3><p>The High School mode allows the player to create a school of their choice, including team name, and color of uniform. This mode is the simplest of the three modes in terms of both controls and play selection. Only 8 plays are allowed on offense and defense in order to keep the game to its high school roots.<\/p><h3>College<\/h3><p>College mode has a season mode in which the player can choose knock-off schools from the NCAA. Mascots and school nicknames are not allowed as Nintendo was not being able to secure licenses from both the NCAA and NFLPA. At the end of each game the player can read a newspaper that would highlight the biggest games of the previous week including the top 20 schools in the nation. 16 plays are allowed for both offense and defense as well as expanding the control set from High School mode.<\/p><h3>NFL<\/h3><p>The NFL mode features the most expansive move list and play selection of the three modes. All of the 28 NFL teams (at the time there were 28 teams) are featured with mascots, however without the license from the NFLPA, real-life players could not be added. The season mode is just as robust as the College mode, featuring a full season mode with proper divisions and a playoff match resulting in the Super Bowl.<\/p>","id":455,"name":"Super Play Action Football","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/super-play-action-football\/3030-455\/"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>Space Ace is <a href=\"\/don-bluth\/3040-45789\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-45789\">Don Bluth<\/a>'s less-successful follow up to <a href=\"\/dragons-lair\/3030-23\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23\">Dragon's Lair<\/a>. Much of the same development team from Dragon's Lair worked on Space Ace, and the arcade cabinet utilized the same Laserdisc technology. For Space Ace, Bluth set out to push the Laserdisc technology beyond what he had previously showcased in Dragon's Lair, primarily by making greater use of its random-access abilities to create numerous <a href=\"\/branching-story-line\/3015-1646\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1646\">branching pathways<\/a>. Instead of building one linear sequence, and killing the player if they missed an action, the game could often incorporate a \"miss\" into its narrative and continue on.<\/p><p>Just as was tried with the randomization of sequences in Dragon's Lair, the idea was that a player could have a different experience on the second, third, or even tenth play - in this case, checking out content they missed in the previous play. Space Ace was also designed to have a greater emphasis on story and characterization. To this point, unlike in Dragon's Lair, all the scenes happen in a specific order, with the occasional branching opportunities appearing within. This was done to address the \"collection of disjointed scenes\" criticism of Dragon's Lair.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/1654563-sa11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1654563\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/1654563-sa11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1654563\"><img alt=\"Kimberly and Ace.\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/1654563-sa11.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/1654563-sa11.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Kimberly and Ace.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The player controls the titular Space Ace on the trail of an evil alien mastermind named Borf. Borf has developed a new weapon, the \"Infanto Ray\", which he intends to use to enslave the population of Earth. While scouting Borf's space station, Ace's gal, Kimberly, is kidnapped and Ace himself is hit with the Infanto Ray. The ray transforms him into a lanky kid named Dexter, and leaves him in a state of fluctuating between these two forms.<\/p><p>The player must fly, shoot, and dodge their way through Borf's lair, save Kimberly, reverse the effects of the Infanto Ray, and put a stop to Borf's plans for good.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Gameplay is essentially identical to what was introduced in Dragon's Lair. The player has a joystick to select directions, and a \"Shoot\" button to perform actions. Animation plays up to a decision point, at which time the player has a second or less to react before the game will branch to a new path, or Ace will lose a life.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/1654562-sa10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1654562\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.79310344827586\" data-width=\"348\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 348px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/1654562-sa10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1654562\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/117445\/1654562-sa10.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/1654562-sa10.jpg 348w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/117445\/1654562-sa10.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><\/figure><p>Sections of the animation will quickly flash yellow to indicate both when and how the player should react. If a door on the left flashes, the player should flick the stick left to travel through the door. The action Ace will take after a successful move is often unpredictable, with the intention being that Ace's antics will surprise and entertain the player. If the player misses an action that results in death, they lose a life from their stock of 3 and must restart at the beginning of that section.<\/p><p>Space Ace's main hook is its transforming protagonist. The player defaults to Dexter, whose cannot use a weapon, and whose sections are therefore based around dodging and avoiding hazards. Numerous times throughout the adventure, the player will get the option to \"Energize\". If they press the Shoot button in time, Dexter will transform into Ace, a muscular hero who can use his laser pistol to blast through enemies. Due to the branching pathway technology, if the player does not transform into Ace, they will often continue on an altered path as Dexter.<\/p><p>Space Ace also introduced difficulty levels (Cadet, Captain, and Ace) whereas Dragon's Lair had only one. The difficulty levels were intended to make the game accessible to a wider audience, however, this was achieved by simply skipping over the more difficult sections. Nearly half the available scenes are playable on Cadet, and roughly 2\/3rds on Captain, forcing players to master the Ace difficulty to see all the content.<\/p><h2>Presentation<\/h2><p>As with Dragon's Lair, hand-drawn cell animation was used running at 24 frames a second - the same as with an animated feature film. Colors were vibrant and detail unsurpassed by anything standard arcade hardware (or computers) could generate or display. A few of the sequences used models for <a href=\"\/rotoscoping\/3015-1249\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1249\">rotoscoping<\/a>, namely the spaceships, motorcycle, and tunnel and rocket skates scenes.<\/p><p>Dragon's Lair's Chris Stone provided the soundtrack, this time more theatrical, continuous, and now recorded and presented in stereo. Space Ace features more dialogue than Dragon's Lair, so Bluth's studio did look for professional voice talent. In the end, to save money, they decided again to pull voices from within the studio. The sole professional voice talent is <a href=\"\/michael-rye\/3040-62906\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-62906\">Michael Rye<\/a>, reprising his role from Dragon's Lair as the game's narrator.<\/p><ul><li><b>Space Ace<\/b> - Jeff Etter (animator)<\/li><li><b>Dexter<\/b> - Will Finn (animator\/story)<\/li><li><b>Kimberley<\/b> - Lorna Pomeroy (animator)<\/li><li><b>Borf<\/b> - Don Bluth<\/li><\/ul><h2>Versions<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/1654556-sa.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1654556\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/1654556-sa.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1654556\"><img alt=\"Atari ST version.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/1654556-sa.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/1654556-sa.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Atari ST version.\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/1654556-sa.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/1654556-sa.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Atari ST version.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Initial ports were for home computers, and shipped on multiple <a href=\"\/floppy-disk\/3055-2715\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2715\">floppy disks<\/a>.

The Sega CD release naturally featured the most compressed video, but the gameplay was largely intact. Modern releases, such as for iOS, use advanced video compression to the same effect. Digital Leisure also released a DVD version of the game, playable in most home DVD players by using the arrow keys on the remote. A similar Blu-Ray release of Space Ace and Dragon's Lair was completed in 2008.<\/p><h2>Reception<\/h2><p>Though Don Bluth set out to make a game that surpassed Dragon's Lair as a true showcase of animation, most arcade owners weren't impressed. Ace's increased difficulty level was cited as a problem, as was the decision to originally only offer Space Ace as a new cabinet (rather than a conversion kit). Space Ace also had the misfortune of hitting in the center of the 1983-84 video game crash, when consumer interest in the entire industry was noticeably suffering.<\/p><p>Owners also seemed less interested in a different, but similar, game to the original Dragon's Lair as they were in an actual sequel for it.

For many years the two kingdoms were peaceful, until one fateful day six powerful crests fell from the sky into the demons' lands. The demons began to fight amongst themselves over the control of these mysterious artifacts, as it was rumored their combined magics were sufficient to make those who possessed them powerful beyond measure. Eventually, a single red demon by the name of Firebrand proved to be more cunning and vicious than his brethren, securing the Crests of Fire, Earth, Air, Water, and Time for himself. Not content to have only five of the six crests, however, Firebrand challenged the demon <a href=\"\/dragons\/3015-551\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-551\">dragon<\/a> Somulo for possession of the final crest, the Crest of Heaven. The ensuing battle tested both combatants to their limits, but ultimately the demon dragon succumbed, and Firebrand emerged as the undisputed master of the crests.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2020402-phalanx_crests.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2020402\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2020402-phalanx_crests.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2020402\"><img alt=\"Phalanx obtains the coveted crests.\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/118253\/2020402-phalanx_crests.png\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2020402-phalanx_crests.png 512w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/118253\/2020402-phalanx_crests.png 480w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/118253\/2020402-phalanx_crests.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Phalanx obtains the coveted crests.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Firebrand's control over the six crests was brief, however. Taking to the skies following his battle with Somulo, Firebrand finds himself attacked unexpectedly by another of his kind, the scheming Phalanx, who took advantage of his weakened state in order to pry the crests from him. Though his exact motives are unclear, Phalanx harbors ambitions of ruling over both the human and demon realms, and he knows that the crests will give him the power to do so. Phalanx successfully wrests all six crests from his wounded opponent, though a single shard of the Crest of Fire, which splintered into five pieces during the fight, still remains in Firebrand's possession at the end of their confrontation.<\/p><p>Defeated but still alive, Firebrand swears to take revenge against the opportunistic Phalanx and reacquire the crests. His vengeance will not be easy, though. Wary that some jealous demon would come to take the crests from him in the same manner that he took them from Firebrand, Phalanx separates the crests and spreads them arcross the demon realm, keeping only the Crest of Heaven on his person. Before he can properly challenge Phalanx for the Crest of Heaven, Firebrand must first search the land for the four hidden crests while also recovering the shattered remnants of the Crest of Fire. Time is of the essence. Phalanx intends to use the six crests to create the Crest of Infinity, which would make him unstoppable. Only the small sliver of the Crest of Fire which remains in Firebrand's possession prevents him from doing so.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>The main action of Demon's Crest takes place on traditional side-scrolling levels, many of which contain archetypal stage themes (<a href=\"\/lava-stage\/3015-532\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-532\">fire level<\/a>, <a href=\"\/water-level\/3015-1713\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1713\">water level<\/a>, <a href=\"\/ice-stage\/3015-2076\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2076\">ice level<\/a>, etc.), in which players must travel from left to right, defeating or avoiding enemies, navigating environmental hazards like <a href=\"\/spikes\/3055-183\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-183\">spikes<\/a> and <a href=\"\/fire\/3015-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1443\">flames<\/a>, and occasionally squaring off against bosses. While the game's introductory stage is predetermined, after its completion players are allowed to choose their next location by flying Firebrand there via an <a href=\"\/overworld\/3015-1004\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1004\">overworld<\/a>, which essentially acts as a level selection interface. Important locations (that is, those that are tied to the player's main quest) are marked on the map in order to indicate their significance, while a number of other secondary shops and hidden locales can be access through exploration. While accessible stages can be played in any order, their difficulty, and thus their intended order of completion, is signified by a numeric indicator on the game's <a href=\"\/world-map\/3015-611\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-611\">world map<\/a>.

Bosses typically yield boons such as crests, new abilities, or health upgrades upon defeat, and the levels themselves often hide additional items such as talismans, which provide passive benefits, as well as urns and vellum, which can be used for potions and spellcasting respectively. Many levels include branching pathways which encourage additional playthroughs, and it is often necessary to revisit earlier levels with abilities acquired later on, as completion of certain side paths may be extremely difficult or entirely impossible without a particular item. Once a player has completed a certain amount of the game, the Tower of Phalanx is unlocked. From that point forward, the player is free to engage the game's final battle when they see fit. Players who resist the urge to challenge Phalanx immediately are rewarded with better endings and the possibility of additional post-ending content based on their completion percentage upon finishing the final battle.<\/p><p>When not tackling the game's main stages, the player can access several non-combat areas via the overworld. These mostly consist of shops which allow players to purchase one-time use potions and spells for Firebrand with currency gathered throughout the game. Additional urns and vellum increase the maximum number of potions and spells that can be stored at one time, though ultimately gold is also required in order to purchase them. Outside of purchasing items, activities in these neutral areas is somewhat limited. A few <a href=\"\/non-player-character\/3015-967\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">non-player characters<\/a> can be engaged with, and an additional <a href=\"\/headbutt\/3015-3215\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3215\">headbutting<\/a> <a href=\"\/minigames\/3015-116\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">mini-game<\/a> can be played for fun and profit.

The player starts with only one fragment of the crest in their possession at the game's commencement, and unlike other crests, each additional piece of the Crest of Fire must be gathered individually before the crest can be considered whole. The basic abilities of his normal form include the use of his wings to hover after jumping, utilization of his talons to indefinitely cling to non-spiked wall surfaces, and headbutting, which breaks certain background items. These traits do not change with the acquisition of additional fire shards, nor does Firebrand's appearance, but new shards grant Firebrand access to additional projectiles while in his default state, each with their own properties. Only one of the available projectile types can be in active use at any given time, and furthermore these cannot be used concurrently with other crests, though players can cycle between the different projectile types at will through the game's menu.<\/p><table><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2017677-fire.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2017677\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.29166666666667\" data-width=\"48\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 48px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:29.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2017677-fire.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2017677\"><img alt=\"Fire\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48px) 100vw, 48px\" data-width=\"48\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2017677-fire.png\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2017677-fire.png 48w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Fire\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2017677-fire.png\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2017677-fire.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48px) 100vw, 48px\" data-width=\"48\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Fire<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/td><td><h3>Fire<\/h3> The fireball is a staple of the Red Arremer clan, and the only ability which Firebrand starts the game with.

Once an individual crest is found, Firebrand may use it at any later point to transform into a version of himself which is imbued with the powers of that particular crest. He may then stay in any of these forms indefinitely, though it is often prudent to switch between crests frequently depending on the situation. Additional forms grant abilities that Firebrand's default form does not have access to, and in fact many areas of the game are designed such that certain crests will be better suited than others.<\/p><p>As powerful as they are, It is worth noting that switching to new forms may cause the player to lose abilities that are available to them in the default form. For instance, certain transformations are wingless, and therefor have no ability to hover, while several forms also lack Firebrand's basic headbutt ability, which is accessible to him from the start of the game. This means that it can sometimes be wise to fall back on Firebrand's basic gargoyle form, which has a more well-rounded set of abilities. This is especially true of forms which are more specialized in nature, such as the Tidal Gargoyle.<\/p><table><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2017680-ground_gargoyle.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2017680\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.56\" data-width=\"50\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 50px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2017680-ground_gargoyle.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2017680\"><img alt=\"Ground Gargoyle\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 50px) 100vw, 50px\" data-width=\"50\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2017680-ground_gargoyle.png\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2017680-ground_gargoyle.png 50w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ground Gargoyle\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2017680-ground_gargoyle.png\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2017680-ground_gargoyle.png 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 50px) 100vw, 50px\" data-width=\"50\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Ground Gargoyle<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/td><td><h3>Crest of Earth<\/h3> Received after the player's first confrontation with Arma, the Crest of Earth transforms Firebrand into a mighty Ground Gargoyle.

The Baron has stashed away large sums and Brigand is willing to risk his life to find the loot. He has average abilities and begins the mission with a Rifle and Shotburst.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Brigand is an average character, the basic jack of all trades. His weapon is powerful when upgraded, and his Shotburst can be useful if used in the right situation.<\/p><h3><a href=\"..\/..\/gentleman\/94-8770\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Gentleman<\/a><\/h3><blockquote><p>\"The intelligence and speed of the Gentleman keeps him at the top of his game. While he's not very strong, the Gentleman can avoid a lot of trouble with his quick moves. He starts with a Flame Pistol and mapping abilities.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Gentleman is very similar to Brigand, only with a faster movement speed and less damaging regular shots. He has the map, which is useful to navigate through the levels.<\/p><h3><a href=\"..\/..\/thug\/94-8768\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Thug<\/a><\/h3><blockquote><p>\"The ox-like Thug is a mutant powerhouse who can withstand a big beating and still fight back with a mighty force. His Shotgun fires several small shells and the Molotov weapon that he begins with sends out a circle of flame\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Along with Navvie, Thug is one of the 2 \"heavy duty\" characters. Boasting impressive firepower, they are somewhat limited due to their incredibly slow movement speed.<\/p><h3><a href=\"..\/..\/mercenary\/94-8766\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Mercenary<\/a><\/h3><blockquote><p>\"Experience is on the Mercenary's side. This fighter is a veteran of many battles and a good leader. While his abilities are average, Mercenary does make good use of a Gatling Gun and he is an expert with explosives\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The Mercenary is a very useful character, and one which is often advised to select as an AI partner, due to his \"First Aid\" ability, which heals both players instantly to full health. His firepower is sub-par, especially in the later stages, being outclassed by several other characters.<\/p><h3><a href=\"..\/..\/navvie\/94-8769\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Navvie<\/a><\/h3><blockquote><p>\"The strongest fighter of the group got his physical training by building roads and canals. He also had a stint with the army where he learned to make weapons. Navvie begins the mission with a powerful Cannon and Dynamite\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Navvie is the most powerful character in-game. Boasting the highest firepower in-game, which also encompasses knockback, he is one of the most powerful characters. However, like Thug, he suffers from painful movement speed. He also boasts \"Dynamite\" as a special weapon, which clears the entire screen of enemies.<\/p><h3><a href=\"..\/..\/preacher\/94-8767\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Scientist<\/a> (Preacher in other versions)<\/h3><blockquote><p>\"The Scientist is the brains of the bunch. He is smart and fast. While his homemade Lightning Gun may not be the toast of the town, the First Aid Kit with which he begins the mission makes him a good member of the team\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The Scientist often comes off as the most specialized character. Featuring a weak weapon which can pierce enemies at higher levels, and the fastest run speed in-game, he is a powerful yet difficult character to master. He also has the most powerful special attacks in-game, such as Freeze and First Aid.<\/p><h2>Special Items<\/h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Name<\/th><th>Description<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Shotburst<\/td><td>Sends a wave of bullets in a 360 degree angle around the character, killing everything in its path.

The biggest difference between the two is that the bonus level in the Genesis version, which is unlocked through a laborious process, is made to be the first level in the SNES version.

Further, the inclusion of this level in the SNES version created plot incongruities which were corrected by eliminating the ability to use certain away-team members in certain levels.

It becomes apparent he has no memory of events prior to the chase. Upon awakening he notices that he knocked a cube-shaped object off a ledge and sets out to retrieve it. The cube contains a message recorded by the protagonist before he lost his memory. He gives no clues as to what has happened but tells him to seek out his friend Ian who is located in New Washington. Conrad then proceeds to take on the dangers of this jungle to find Ian. After battling enemies in the form of robots and mutants with other obstacles such as turrets and strange fires Conrad eventually comes across a hole in the ground that acts as an entrance to New Washington. An old man who sits near this hole trades an Anti-G Belt that negates the effects of gravity to some extent, for some credits allowing Conrad access to his next location.<\/p><p>A short while after arriving in New Washington Conrad discovers Ian being held by a couple of New Washington Police Officers. After battling these men off Ian places Conrad in a machine that recovers his memories. It is revealed that Conrad had discovered a race of aliens was blending in with the human population on Earth in large quantity implying an eventual take over of the planet. His revelation had caught the attention of this alien race who would try to assassinate him. After they failed the first time it prompted Conrad to record the Holo-Cube message found earlier in the game and to send a copy of his memories to Ian. The game's manual would also explain that the alien race is called Morphs and killed Conrad's girlfriend. One night the aliens finally captured Conrad and took him aboard their ship. On this night they erased his memory but failed to secure him as Conrad would awaken and flee his captures, leading to what was witnessed at the beginning of the game.<\/p><h3>Employment<\/h3><p>With his memories restored Conrad decides he needs to return to Earth. With little money however, this was never going to be as easy as it sounds. Ian suggests that Conrad should take part in a TV Show where he must fight Cyborgs for a chance to win a ticket to Earth. As it would be too dangerous to compete under his own name Conrad has to get false ID papers. Ian sends him to a contact named Jack, who demands 1,500 credits for the papers. Since he doesn't have that sort of cash on hand Conrad partakes in multiple odd jobs available in New Washington.<\/p><p>First he is hired by Titan Spaces Lines for an apparently easy job of collecting and delivering a parcel. Just outsides the parcels destination he is attacked by a member of the NWPD but overcomes him and delivers the package.<\/p><p>The second mission comes from Virtual Crop that requests Conrad escort a VIP to their research center. It is made clear that the mission will require a firearm ad the area traveled in will be dangerous. The warning is well advised since mutants infest the area in addition to malfunctioning Security Spheres. Like previously though Conrad succeeds.<\/p><p>Titan TV hires Conrad for the third mission. They report that a Model Cy-Borg 2.1 has escaped with the possible assistance of an outsider. It carries a virus which could spread to all other functioning cyborgs. A police officer informs Conrad that the Cy-Borg wants to make a deal. This turns out to be a trap however and Conrad kills the Police Officer for access to 2.1\u2019s lair. Once in his hideout Conrad eliminates 2.1.<\/p><p>The penultimate New Washington mission is accomplished for Titan Senior Advisory Board. Sabotage to the generator that supplies power to New Washington means the city is on the verge of blowing up. Conrad has 90 seconds to locate the sabotaged area and repair it. With only seconds left Conrad repairs the generator and saves New Washington.<\/p><p>With only one mission required to gain the necessary credits for the false papers, another party hires Conrad to eliminate the mutant threat that is lurking in all the Restricted Areas. After accomplishing this task Conrad meets Jack one more time who now hands over the papers allowing entry into the game show.<\/p><p>The game show of requires participants to fight their way through eight different levels of deadly situations. Littered throughout every level are Cy-Borg 2.1s, Sentry Spheres and mines. Conrad manages to fight through all levels and win a ticket to Earth.<\/p><h3>Back on Earth<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6763\/462603-s_flashback_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-462603\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.6765625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6763\/462603-s_flashback_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-462603\"><img alt=\"Earth\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6763\/462603-s_flashback_7.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6763\/462603-s_flashback_7.jpg 640w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/6763\/462603-s_flashback_7.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6763\/462603-s_flashback_7.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Earth<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Conrad believes The Morphs have a hidden base within a night club on Earth but upon arrival is attacked by the local law enforcement and security measures.

Further into their lair Conrad finally confronts the Morphs in combat. With their ability to take and lose shape whenever they want Conrad has a difficult time but overcomes everyone he meets. With the realization that the Morph invasion is close with no time to report it, Conrad teleports to the Morph home planet with the intention of stopping their conquest.<\/p><p>On the planet Conrad tries to assist a human prisoner who is in possession of explosives. Unfortunately the man is killed by a Morph upon his release but lives long enough to give Conrad the destructive device. Conrad discovers a diary on the planet that reveals a captive human scientist managed to enter the theory of molecular research into a Titan computer. This theory was taken up by Conrad who made glasses revealing the aliens living among the human population. It is also revealed that The Master Brain, positions at the center of the planet, controls all morphs, destroying him will end the race. The device Conrad holds was created by the scientist and is powerful enough to destroy the entire planet.<\/p><p>With other options being non-existent, Conrad decides to put the scientist's plan into action. He travels all the way into the planet\u2019s core. After battling more Morphs the Master Brain is killed. After dropping the Atomic Charge into the foundations of the planet Conrad races against time to escape the planet in a docked ship before the planet explodes.<\/p><p>Conrad only just makes it, with the ship just out of reach from the destructive force of the Atomic Device. Conrad soon learns though that he is in a galaxy unrecognized by the ship\u2019s systems.

The player must also top up their water levels by moving to a water source and refilling the tank. In addition to the tank, there's a supply of water bombs, which clear the screen of any fire. These are limited to two or three, however, and are difficult to find.<\/p><p>As Pete and Daniel move from room to room within the Macrotech Building, they encounter unconscious employees.

The story plays out differently depending on whom is in the party. Each character has his and her own set of abilities to use in battle. As the character <a href=\"\/leveling-up\/3015-475\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-475\">levels up<\/a>, the player is prompted to invest points in one of the six different stats (strength, agility, vitality, intelligence, spirit, and luck). When the character reaches level 18, he can go to a mana stone in order to advance to another <a href=\"\/classes\/3015-405\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-405\">class<\/a> -- either toward light or dark. The character may again change class upon reaching level 38 -- again, either toward light or dark. Take note however, in order for the second class to be open to the character, a special item is required. These combinations make up for a total of six different classes (seven including the original vanilla class). Each class grants the character bonus statistics and abilities otherwise non-attainable.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5128\/304733-sd3classchange.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-304733\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5128\/304733-sd3classchange.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-304733\"><img alt=\"A class tree showing the six different paths.\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5128\/304733-sd3classchange.gif\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5128\/304733-sd3classchange.gif 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"><\/a><figcaption>A class tree showing the six different paths.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/942702-densetsu4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-942702\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.872\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/942702-densetsu4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-942702\"><img alt=\"The iconic ring menu\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4527\/942702-densetsu4.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/942702-densetsu4.jpg 500w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4527\/942702-densetsu4.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4527\/942702-densetsu4.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>The iconic ring menu<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>As said previously, the player must form a party of three.

They can also break some Blocks by hitting it from below and Spin Jump on Rotating Blocks to break them. This power-up glides across the ground before collected and can sometimes be found by running over special areas (like some bushes). All Yellow Exclamation Blocks contain this power-up. Running over checkpoint gates as regular Mario\/Luigi automatically puts them in Super form.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><a href=\"\/fire-flower\/3055-10\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-10\"><strong>Fire Flower<\/strong><\/a> - Transforms into Fire Mario\/Luigi.

Performing a Spin Jump also throws fireballs on both sides of them. This power-up is usually stationary before collected. In the GBA remake, getting hit while in Fire form changes them into Super form (similar to <a href=\"\/super-mario-bros-3\/3030-10299\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10299\">Super Mario Bros. 3<\/a>).<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><a href=\"\/feather-cape\/3055-525\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-525\"><strong>Cape Feather<\/strong><\/a> - Transforms into Cape Mario\/Luigi.

This power-up floats left and right downward before collected. All Green Exclamation Blocks contain this power-up. Jumping on Super Koopas cause them to drop a Cape Feather.<\/li><\/ul><p>Somewhat similar to Super Mario Bros. 3, players can have the ability to store spare power-ups for use at a later time.

Getting hit (or pressing the Select button in-game) causes the item to slowly descend from the Reserve Box. Also new to the game are Roulette Blocks, which can carry either of these power-ups (along with the Starman power-up below) and is chosen when the player hits the block.<\/p><p>In addition, Mario and Luigi can find two rare power-ups that do not permanently transform them, instead temporarily giving them a special ability:<\/p><ul><li><a href=\"\/starman\/3055-23\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-23\"><strong>Starman<\/strong><\/a> - Grants them <a href=\"\/temporary-invincibility\/3015-266\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-266\">temporary invincibility<\/a>, allowing them to bump onto any enemies to defeat them.

Directed by <a href=\"\/akitoshi-kawazu\/3040-48599\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-48599\">Akitoshi Kawazu<\/a>, who also created 1988's <a href=\"\/final-fantasy-ii\/3030-2094\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2094\">Final Fantasy II<\/a> for the Famicom, the <a href=\"\/saga\/3025-705\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-705\">SaGa<\/a> series was conceived as an off-beat sister series to Squaresoft's core <a href=\"\/final-fantasy\/3025-194\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-194\">Final Fantasy<\/a> franchise. The first three SaGa games were released for the Game Boy platform (known as Final Fantasy Legend overseas) before the introduction of the Super Famicom Romancing SaGa series, which also had three entries starting with this one.<\/p><p>Romancing SaGa, and the SaGa games to follow, would be best known for presenting multiple scenarios with distinct protagonists that the player can progress through in any order they wish.<\/p><p>The game was eventually released for three platforms: the Super Famicom, the Wonderswan, and the Playstation 2. The Super Famicom 1992 release was the original version. The Wonderswan version is just a port of the SFC version, only with minor additions like a new boss battle against Barbara. Both of these versions were not released outside Japan. The Playstation 2 version, however, was not only released in other regions, but is essentially a different game. In fact, the game was released as Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song in Japan, the subtitle being dropped in other regions. Although it follows the same plot as its predecessors, Minstrel Song features new quests, abilities, characters, and vastly different gameplay mechanics.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p>Some time before the beginning of the game, three dark gods (Death, Barbara and Saruin) wage a war against the high god Arol. They were unsuccessful, and all but Saruin were beaten. Instead, Arol locked him away with 10 gemstones, which are then scattered across the Earth. By the beginning of the game, however, the world becomes populated with monsters, and Saruin threatens to return.<\/p><p>This is essentially the only common story element that links the different characters of the game. Instead of one storyline, Romancing SaGa consists of eight separate characters, each with different introductions and stories before they all come together to tackle the same quests.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><h3>Navigation<\/h3><p>Instead of being given a large overworld to explore, Romancing SaGa presents the player with an unexplorable world map with selectable locations they can explore. New locations are unlocked by talking to certain people, exploring other areas, or engaging in certain quests. Getting between other segments of the world map usually requires either passing through an area linking the two segments, or riding a boat between certain towns.<\/p><h3>Battle<\/h3><p>Romancing SaGa, much like other JRPGs of the time, employs a <a href=\"\/turn-based\/3015-192\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-192\"> traditional turn-based<\/a> system of combat. However, unlike other RPGs, battles are not triggered through random encounters, but by approaching them on the map. The difficulty of the battle depends on the direction in which the player approaches them; it is better to sneak up from the sides or back than to engage in a direct attack. The same holds true for the enemies, who can change the player's in-battle formation by approaching their party from the sides or back.<\/p><p>Formation plays an important role in battle, as it decides which characters can use which abilities. Bows, magic and certain abilities can be used from any position; spears can be used in the middle and front positions; and all other weapons and abilities can only be used from the front. Similarly, certain abilities can only hit certain rows of enemies. When all the characters in one row die, the next row moves up. The battle ends when all the combatants on one side die.<\/p><p>Unlike many other RPGs, battles do not end with players gaining experience toward level ups. Instead, each statistic levels up according to how that character fought. For example, heavy use of the bow will cause that character's bow proficiency to level up. Characters learn new abilities (and are able to use abilities more often) by leveling up the corresponding weapon. Magic is bought from certain shops in certain towns, but there are certain magic types that cannot coexist within the same character (ex: fire and water). Both spells and abilities draw from collective pools of points necessary to use the move, but only magic shows these points. However, unlike later games in the series, weapon levels are not tied to the characters, but to the weapons themselves, meaning that upgrading equipment results in the loss of all abilities tied to that specific weapon.<\/p><p>To use items in battle, each character must equip them individually. In addition to usual potions and MP restoring items (which, oddly enough, come specific to each type of magic), Romancing SaGa is the only SaGa game to feature summons, gained through a certain quest. Rather than behaving like an attack, the summons behave more like special characters, taking the place of the entire party for a given number of turns.<\/p><h3>Other gameplay mechanics<\/h3><p>The maximum amount of gold the player's party can carry at any given time is 9999 gold. However, upon selling an item that results in a gold count higher than 10000, the game gives them a jewel, equal to 10000 gold. Since the player stops gaining gold when they hit 9999, it is imperative to sell an item as soon as they hit this cap. This quirk only applies to the SFC and Wonderswan versions; jewels are not present in the PS2 remake.<\/p>","id":1368,"name":"Romancing SaGa","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/romancing-saga\/3030-1368\/"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>First Samurai is an action game with a slight non-linear angle, as the player must hunt each stage for four items before they can fight the boss and move onto the next world.

A puzzle game that requires players to direct a group of green haired, blue-shirted, lemmings from point A to point B. The game is based on the myth that lemmings migrate in large groups and follow a single leader, who would often lead them off a cliff to their demise. In the game, lemmings constantly march in one direction unless they run into an obstacle, at which point they turn around and walk the other way. Being fearless and unaware of their own mortality, the lemmings will blindly run into fire, jump off cliffs, become crushed and fall victim to numerous other pitfalls.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The player must command the lemmings to do certain tasks in order to complete each stage and get a certain percentage of lemmings to safety.

The name Tetris is a portmanteau of the Greek prefix \"tetra\", which means \"four\", and Pajitnov's favorite sport, tennis.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Tetris challenges the player's spatial relation abilities by presenting them with different shapes made of four square blocks. The blocks are presented one at a time at the top of a rectangular play field, and quickly begin descending toward the bottom. The player can rotate the shapes and move them horizontally as they descend, and if you are able to make a complete horizontal line of blocks, that line will clear from the field. In its original form, Tetris was an endurance test, as the speed of the descending shapes would constantly increase as time went on, and the game would end when the play field filled completely with blocks.<\/p><h2>Tetris Variants<\/h2><p>A number of Tetris variations, both official and otherwise, have been released over the years, including <a href=\"\/hatris\/3030-17985\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17985\">Hatris<\/a>, <a href=\"\/welltris\/3030-15385\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15385\">Welltris<\/a>, Super Tetris 2, <a href=\"\/tetris-blast\/3030-13982\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13982\">Tetris Blast<\/a> and <a href=\"\/tetris-attack\/3030-13130\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13130\">Tetris Attack<\/a>.

Pieces come down in pairs, sometimes of different colors. When players connect at least four pieces, they \"pop\" those pieces, making them disappear. Two pieces are \"connected\" when they touch horizontally or vertically but not diagonally. Pieces that were above the popped pieces then fall down to fill the void created. The falling pieces can then create a connection of four similar colored pieces, thus causing a chain.<\/p><p>When the player successfully pops pieces, they send \"garbage\" pieces are the opposing player, falling from random columns. The more pieces in a pop and the longer the chain, the more pieces are sent. These garbage pieces are uncolored and do not chain but if they are adjacent (again, vertically or horizontally but not diagonally) to a popped colored piece, then they also disappear.<\/p><p>The player that hits the top of the well loses.<\/p><h3>Game Modes<\/h3><p>Puyo Puyo is split into two modes:<\/p><h4>Single Puyo Puyo<\/h4><p>In the game's single player mode, the player assumes the role of <a href=\"\/arle-nadja\/3005-14463\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14463\">Arle Nadja<\/a>, a sorceress who takes pleasure in ruining Satan's plans. There are three difficulty levels: \"Beginner\" gives the player three easy opponents unrelated to the main game, \"Normal\" starts the player at Stage 1 (vs. <a href=\"\/draco-centauros\/3005-24689\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24689\">Draco Centauros<\/a>), while \"Difficult\" starts the player at Stage 4 (vs. <a href=\"\/harpy\/3005-24938\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24938\">Harpy<\/a>). There are 13 stages in the normal game, the last of which is a battle against Satan himself.<\/p><h4>Double Puyo Puyo<\/h4><p>This is basically multiplayer mode.

Mean Bean Machine drops the difficulty level system (and the beginner characters with it), but includes a password feature; the game also reuses several Puyo Puyo BGM tracks, such as Satan's theme becoming the Verses Mode and Danger themes. Kirby's Avalanche does not make any gameplay changes but replaces every song except the Danger theme with Kirby-series BGM.<\/p>","id":1916,"name":"Puyo Puyo","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/puyo-puyo\/3030-1916\/"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/252485-magical_quest_starring_mickey_mouse_snes_screenshot1.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-252485\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/252485-magical_quest_starring_mickey_mouse_snes_screenshot1.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-252485\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/252485-magical_quest_starring_mickey_mouse_snes_screenshot1.gif\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/252485-magical_quest_starring_mickey_mouse_snes_screenshot1.gif 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"><\/a><\/figure><p>The Magical Quest Starring Mickey Mouse (released in Japan as \"Mickey's Magical Adventure\") is a side-scrolling platformer developed and originally published by <a href=\"\/capcom\/3010-367\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom<\/a> for the <a href=\"\/snes\/3045-9\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo Entertainment System<\/a> in 1992.

After jumping onto their heads once to stun them, Mickey can also pick up certain smaller enemies to use as projectiles. However, Mickey cannot pick up objects while wearing a costume; instead, pressing Y with a costume equipped will activate the costume's special ability.

They include:<\/p><ul><li><a href=\"\/sailor-moon\/3005-3998\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3998\">Sailor Moon<\/a> - The heroine of the franchise, recognizable by her long blonde pigtails. Standard all-rounder character.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/sailor-mercury\/3005-13041\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13041\">Sailor Mercury<\/a> - The short-haired brunette and the brains of the outfit.

Sailor Mars is feisty and musically-inclined, and most of her repertoire involves fire in some capacity. Her regular attack is a stronger kick, rather than a punch.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/sailor-jupiter\/3005-13043\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13043\">Sailor Jupiter<\/a> - Wears her brown hair in a ponytail. The muscles of the group, Jupiter's attacks are the strongest of any of the playable characters.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/sailor-venus\/3005-13042\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13042\">Sailor Venus<\/a> - The other blonde. She uses a chain in battle, and is the only character to use a weapon. This gives her a longer reach than the other characters.<\/li><\/ul><p>The player, as any one of the five Sailor Soldiers, must progress through five different stages which culminates with a trip to the Dark Kingdom to fight <a href=\"\/queen-beryl\/3005-30493\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-30493\">Queen Beryl<\/a>. Each character fights slightly differently, and each has a different special attack which requires charging up before they can be unleashed.

Worms would later be released on <a href=\"\/steam\/3015-718\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steam<\/a> in 2011 and <a href=\"\/gogcom\/3015-2379\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2379\">GOG.com<\/a> in 2012, though in both cases the version sold is Worms United, not the original game. After completing Worms Davidson would also head up the development of <a href=\"\/worms-the-directors-cut\/3030-18826\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18826\">Worms: The Director's Cut<\/a>, released in 1997, which was an Amiga-exclusive version of Worms that featured a large number of new weapons and game options not previously seen in other iterations of the game, many of which were adopted in <a href=\"\/worms-2\/3030-10097\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10097\">Worms 2<\/a>, released the same year. Both 2006's <a href=\"\/worms-open-warfare\/3030-2544\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2544\">Worms: Open Warfare<\/a> and 2007's <a href=\"\/worms\/3030-20815\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20815\">Worms<\/a> are considered remakes of the original Worms due in large part to similarities in their weapon loadouts.<\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><p>Worms was originally conceived not as a commercial product, but as a distraction for creator Andy Davidson, a fan of local multiplayer games like <a href=\"\/bomberman\/3030-20589\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20589\">Bomberman<\/a> and <a href=\"\/super-mario-kart\/3030-19071\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19071\">Super Mario Kart<\/a>, and his high school friends. It was initially built using borrowed assets from <a href=\"\/psygnosis-limited\/3010-448\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-448\">Psygnosis<\/a>' <a href=\"\/lemmings\/3030-1446\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1446\">Lemmings<\/a>, and the earliest version of Worms was known as Lemartillery as a result. The game eventually became so popular among the students of Davidson's school that it was banned entirely, prompting Davidson to consider the possibility of having his game published. In order to make the game more attractive to would-be publishers, however, the game's graphics had to be reworked, and thus Davidson scrapped the original <a href=\"\/lemmings\/3015-6451\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6451\">lemmings<\/a> on favor of <a href=\"\/worm\/3015-2795\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2795\">worms<\/a>, giving this new iteration the name Total Wormage. Davidson was so intent on getting his game published that after high school he decided to forgo the pursuit of higher education in order to do so. While he continued to work on the game, Davidson used the customers of an Amiga store where he worked as a form of playtesting for Total Wormage.<\/p><p>In one of his efforts to get his game noticed, Davidson submitted Total Wormage into a competition held by Amiga Format, a British Amiga magazine. By Davidson's own admission, though, his entry into the contest did not accomplish what he had hoped, as he neither won nor received any mention in the magazine. Although discouraged by this and a number of failed attempts at garnering attention for Total Wormage by mailing copies to publishers and developers, Davidson had one final idea: to take the game to the European Computer Trade Show in London. This would prove to be the turning point in Davidson's fortunes, as while there he demoed the game to Team17, who showed an immediate interest in it. Team17 offered to help Davidson develop and publish the game; much of their work went into porting Worms to other game systems, as the original Amiga version that Davidson had been working on was by this time fairly well-developed. In total, Davidson estimates that he spent about four years of his life in the development of Worms.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Gameplay in Worms consists of actions taken by between two and four teams of human- or A.I.-controlled worms on a two-dimensional playing field. The game is turn-based, with each player being able to move a single worm per turn; turns typically end once a worm has either fired a weapon or sustained damage, although they can also end automatically if the allotted time for a turn runs out. From there, play shifts to the next player in the sequence, which is determined randomly at the beginning of gameplay, and that player proceeds in the same fashion. The objective of worms at all times is to cause as much damage to enemy worms as possible while also preserving one's own worms. Each worms starts the round with a certain amount of hit points (typically one hundred), and if their hit points are reduced to zero, they will die, leaving behind a <a href=\"\/tombstone\/3055-1779\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1779\">gravestone<\/a> and creating a small explosion that can harm nearby worms. Worms can also be killed instantaneously by being knocked outside the boundaries of the level or into liquid substances that reside at the bottom of the stage. If a player loses all four of their worms, they are eliminated, and the winner of a given round is the player that survives the match without being eliminated.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2325670-banana_bomb_destruction.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2325670\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2325670-banana_bomb_destruction.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2325670\"><img alt=\"A Banana Bomb causing widespread destruction.

At top, opposing players' health bars can be seen; within the lower HUD, a wind strength indicator (top right) and power bar (bottom right) are visible.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Each player starts the match with an assortment of armaments and utilities in order to aid them in their goal of dominating their opposition. This includes staple weapons such as <a href=\"\/bazooka\/3055-2394\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2394\">bazookas<\/a> and <a href=\"\/grenade\/3055-111\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-111\">grenades<\/a>, which can be used frequently, to more powerful weaponry such as <a href=\"\/homing-missile\/3055-857\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-857\">homing missiles<\/a> and <a href=\"\/dynamite\/3055-390\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-390\">dynamite<\/a> that can only be used a finite number of times. Worms also contains a handful of \"super weapons\" such as <a href=\"\/banana-bomb\/3055-412\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-412\">banana bombs<\/a> and explosive <a href=\"\/sheep\/3015-3107\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3107\">sheep<\/a>, which can only be obtained through periodic weapon crate drops during a match; these items are extremely potent, though incredibly rare to find. Some weapons require that the player be able to accurately gauge the proper weapon trajectory and launch power necessary to hit a target, which can be further complicated by the inclusion of wind conditions that can affect certain projectiles while in flight. In addition to weapons, Worms also offers a number of movement utilities designed more for defense or traversal than offense; this includes items like <a href=\"\/ninja-rope\/3055-3529\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3529\">ninja ropes<\/a> and <a href=\"\/teleporter\/3055-348\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-348\">teleporters<\/a>, which allow different ways of moving around the environment, and items like blow torches and <a href=\"\/jackhammer\/3055-3940\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3940\">pneumatic drills<\/a> that can carve through obstructions.<\/p><p>Environments in Worms are completely destructible, and almost all weapons cause some amount of deformation to the terrain. Over time, this reduces the size of the overall play area, making defensive positioning increasingly difficult while simultaneously increasing the danger that players will fall or be forced off of the map. In order to help make the game more replayable, levels in Worms are also randomly generated, and prior to a match players can cycle through maps indefinitely until they find one to their liking. Several other aspects of the game are adjustable as well, though not all of these variables have a dramatic affect on gameplay. Team and individual worm names can be changed, starting hit point totals can be set between seventy-five and five hundred points, and the intelligence level of A.I. opponents can be tweaked. The availability of all of the game's default weapons can be tailored to suit personal tastes, and Sudden Death, a late-game stalemate breaker that reduces all worms to one hit point, can be made to occur sooner, later, or not at all. A number of other variables exist as well, such as default worm placement and turn length, and an optional Banzai mode is also included which makes explosions even more destructive.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><p>The Worms arsenal includes more than twenty weapons and utilities that vary in strength and purpose. All but three of these tools are given automatically to the player during a match, while the others are designated as \"super weapons,\" and must be collected from randomized weapon crates (although these crates can also contain other weapons or booby traps). A wide variety of different armaments are represented in Worms, including melee weapons, firearms, and a variety of explosives that may be thrown, dropped, propelled by rockets, or conveyed in less-than-orthodox ways. Some usable items are classified as utilities, and while these objects may cause damage to enemies in some cases, the intent of utility items is generally to offer worms additional mobility or defensive options.

Once the fuse is detonated, it splits into five distinct explosives that scatter and fall to the ground, causing additional damage to any worms within a short vicinity of the initial blast.

Even so, it is usually only worth considering if the blast will affect multiple worms.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2323511-prod.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2323511\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2323511-prod.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2323511\"><img alt=\"Prod\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48px) 100vw, 48px\" data-width=\"48\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2323511-prod.png\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2323511-prod.png 48w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Prod\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2323511-prod.png\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118253\/2323511-prod.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48px) 100vw, 48px\" data-width=\"48\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Prod<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/td><td><h3>Prod<\/h3><ul><li><strong>Damage:<\/strong> None<\/li><li><strong>Hotkey:<\/strong> F11<\/li><\/ul> The Prod is the ultimate Worms insult: an attack that does no damage.

This can be useful if a worm has no viable means of attack or if the player simply wishes to force their opponent's hand. If a worm is burrowed safely underground, for instance, a player might decide to skip their turn rather than risk retaliation by leaving and going on the offensive.

It is regarded as the most competitive game in the <a href=\"\/mortal-kombat\/3025-7\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-7\">Mortal Kombat<\/a> franchise (prior to <a href=\"\/mortal-kombat\/3030-25042\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25042\">its 2011 reboot<\/a>). A special version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was later released for consoles (known as <a href=\"\/mortal-kombat-trilogy\/3030-8279\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8279\">Mortal Kombat Trilogy<\/a>).<\/p><p>In order to free up space on the game's memory, the screens detailing the game's story, as well as all of the biographies and picture endings for the original characters, have been removed. Regardless, the game's story is no different from Mortal Kombat 3 (involving <a href=\"\/outworld\/3035-23\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-23\">Outworld<\/a> emperor <a href=\"\/shao-kahn\/3005-91\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-91\">Shao Kahn's<\/a> invasion of <a href=\"\/earth\/3035-65\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-65\">Earthrealm<\/a>).<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is built off of Mortal Kombat 3 and retains most of its gameplay mechanics. There are four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick) and dedicated Block and Run buttons. Players have a \"Run Meter\", which limits their ability to run forward, and \"<a href=\"\/combo\/3015-18\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-18\">chain combos<\/a>\", in which players can perform pre-programmed combos (by linking normal attacks together) that ends with an attack that sends the opponent flying. The combos are known for not necessarily requiring the user to be 100% accurate on the timing of the button presses, allowing the player to basically press all the buttons in the combo quickly and the combo would essentially play itself out. Each character has new special moves, chain combos, and gameplay balances.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8491\/601505-brutality.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-601505\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.71875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8491\/601505-brutality.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-601505\"><img alt=\"BRUTALITY!\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8491\/601505-brutality.png\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8491\/601505-brutality.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>BRUTALITY!<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><a href=\"\/fatality\/3015-10\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-10\">Fatalities<\/a>, <a href=\"\/friendship\/3015-2084\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2084\">Friendships<\/a>, <a href=\"\/babality\/3015-2081\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2081\">Babalities<\/a>, <a href=\"\/mercy\/3015-2093\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2093\">Mercy<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/animality\/3015-2082\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2082\">Animalities<\/a> return from Mortal Kombat 3.

Brutalities are long, complex combo strings that, when performed successfully, end with the victim exploding into a shower of blood and body parts. Brutalities require the player to enter the first ten button presses in the combo, and the game takes over from there, depicting the character beating the other character faster and faster until they explode.<\/p><p>The game also marks the return of the Endurance Match (originally in <a href=\"\/mortal-kombat\/3030-15743\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15743\">Mortal Kombat<\/a>), in which the player must defeat two opponents consecutively instead of one to win a round. The \"Choose Your Destiny\" screen reflects this, adding one Endurance Matches to each \"tower\". Additionally, there is a \"Master II\" difficulty, adding another Endurance Match to the \"tower\" while making the game more difficult.<\/p><p>More \"Kombat Kodes\", six-digit codes that are entered cooperatively on the versus screen, have been added, including the ability to change the stage to whatever both players feel like playing. There are now three \"Ultimate Kombat Kodes\", ten-digit codes that are entered during the <a href=\"\/game-over\/3015-372\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-372\">Game Over<\/a> screen, with three new characters to unlock.

The Achievements are notorious for having strange point values, such as 12. This version also includes online leaderboards, adjustable screen sizes (with support for widescreen and standard televisions), and an online mode similar to the \"Quarter Match\" mode on the Xbox Live Arcade version of <a href=\"\/street-fighter-ii-turbo-hyper-fighting\/3030-8161\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8161\">Super Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting<\/a>. This version was granted \"Arcade Hits\" status due to high sales, reducing its price by half. However, in February 2010, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was removed from the Xbox Live Marketplace due to Midway losing the game's publishing rights. The standalone version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 never returned to Xbox 360 under new publisher, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.

The new layout has a \"special\" button, which is usually mapped to a character's signature special move. As an example, instead of back-back-low punch for <a href=\"\/scorpion\/3005-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1\">Scorpion<\/a>'s spear, the player just has to hit the \"special\" button. Also instead of high and low punch and high and low kick, there are just punch and kick buttons. <a href=\"\/fatality\/3015-10\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-10\">Fatalities<\/a> are also included, along with <a href=\"\/babality\/3015-2081\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2081\">babalities<\/a>, <a href=\"\/friendship\/3015-2084\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2084\">friendships<\/a>, <a href=\"\/brutality\/3015-2083\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2083\">brutalities<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/animality\/3015-2082\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2082\">animalities<\/a>.

In the end, Kilbaba's escape in a gasoline truck is cut short and the Drug Lord is presumed dead after attempting to flee in a bus.

Each character have <a href=\"\/special-attacks\/3015-327\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-327\">special moves<\/a> whose input commands are shown during the course of the game (after every bonus round) as opposed to being given in an instruction card in the game's cabinet.<\/p><p>The game introduced a unique and novel fighting game concept to the franchise: that fighters can fight on two different areas (known as \"lines\" or \"planes\") instead of just one. This allows characters to dodge attacks and projectiles completely rather than block them. While this was heavily expanded in later games, this game does not allow the player character to freely move among the lines. Instead, the player character can knock the opponent to the other area and follow up with a quick roll or a jump kick. Some stages have only one area, with the other area blocked off by obstacles (in which knocking the opponent into the obstacles bounce them back to the main area).<\/p><p>After every two matches, the player is allowed to participate in a bonus round in which they <a href=\"\/arm-wrestling\/3015-2824\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2824\">arm wrestle<\/a> a machine by mashing the Punch button as fast as possible.<\/p><p>Fatal Fury is the only fighting game in the series where if a second player joins in the middle of a fight, the fight is not interrupted so that the two players could battle. Instead, before the actual versus battle takes place, both players fight the CPU opponent in a two-on-one fight.<\/p><h2>Characters<\/h2><p>Despite there being 11 total fighters in this fighting game, only three are playable in the arcade version. The other fighters are only playable on the SNES and Genesis ports in their Versus Modes only (although the SNES version only allowed the second player to play as the other players).<\/p><p><a href=\"\/hwa-jai\/3005-9390\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9390\">Hwa Jai<\/a> and <a href=\"\/billy-kane\/3005-3758\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3758\">Billy Kane<\/a> are not included as fighters in the Genesis port.

It should be noted that despite being the first game released in the <a href=\"\/ogre-battle\/3025-690\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-690\">Ogre Battle<\/a> series it is actually the fifth game in terms of storyline. Taking place twenty four years after the formation of the brutal Zetegenian Empire, the people of the old kingdoms live under constant persecution by the current regime. As the ambitious leader of the rebel army the player is tasked by the old wizard <a href=\"\/warren-moons\/3005-5469\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5469\">Warren<\/a> to gather their forces and liberate the people from oppression.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>The game was unique at its time being an odd hybrid of <a href=\"\/games\/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=12\/\">real time strategy<\/a> and <a href=\"\/games\/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=5\/\">RPG<\/a>. The game progresses linearly (aside from certain secret levels unlocked by fulfilling certain requirements during battle) leading the player from one battle to the next. Before these battles the player can manage his army with a variety of options. Most importantly is the formation of squads, which are created by grouping together units. There are a large variety of units ranging from doll masters to werewolves as well as several special hero units (though many are just improved versions of existing classes). Squads consist of three to five units placed on a three by three grid, with their placement on this grid dictating their actions in battle. As with most RPGs, units gain experience and level, often leading to more advanced classes. Units can also be equipped with items to further increase their effectiveness<\/p><p>Battles take place in real time on large maps with the player starting at his home base and fielding his squads into the battle at a cost. The player controls his squads by issuing move orders which they fulfill to the best of their ability. The objective is to reach the enemy's stronghold and liberate it by occupying that space while preventing the enemy from taking the player's own base. Along the way towns can also be liberated to help the player's cause. Towns provide information, units to hire, items to buy, and income. When an enemy squad comes into contact with a player's squad the two squads \"fight it out\" in a quick computer controlled battle. The units in both squads act out whatever actions their placement dictates, with the squad suffering the most damage or losing their leader unit being declared the loser and as a result being pushed backwards on the map. The user has limited control in these battles with only a few options such as using a limited number of tarot cards (magic spells) or giving the AI a certain routine to follow such as attack the leader. This continues until one side's home base is captured. The story is presented during battles through conversations when encountering certain squads (generally the boss squad sitting their home base) and also through brief cut scenes between battles.<\/p><p>While the game is lauded for its depth in terms of customization it is also criticized for its brutal learning curve. Many features are poorly documented or explained, and as a result can only be discovered via trial and error. Many a player would unwittingly progress quite far into the game only to realize his forces have been improperly trained and are vastly inferior when compared to the enemy. The game also featured <a href=\"\/multiple-endings\/3015-27\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-27\">multiple endings<\/a>, however due to the aforementioned poor documentation; Especially in regards to the reputation and alignment system, many players would receive a \"bad\" ending, where they themselves have become a blood thirsty tyrant with many of the characters they encountered plotting against them. Whether this is some kind of social commentary about the nature of war or simply poor game design has yet to be and probably never will be determined.<\/p><p>Despite these criticisms the game is loved by fans for its massive depth, endearing charm, and poignant storyline.<\/p><h2>Trivia<\/h2><p>The band <em>Queen<\/em> is said to have inspired <a href=\"\/yasumi-matsuno\/3040-45995\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-45995\">Yasumi Matsuno<\/a> when creating the series.

During that time, four brave souls became the world's last ray of hope and accepted the challenge of trying to stop the Sinistals; these heroes were known as Maxim, Selan, <a href=\"\/artea\/3005-10470\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10470\"> Artea<\/a>, and Guy. The heroes ventured forth to the Fortress of Doom to attempt to defeat the evil Sinistrals and eventually succeeded. After the Sinistrals were defeated, the floating island started to collapse. Weak from the battle, Selan didn't have enough strength to walk, and Maxim refused to leave her side. Artea and Guy became separated from them and escaped just before the island collapsed; however, Maxim and Selan weren't so lucky and perished.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/951986-lufia_1_small.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-951986\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.87777777777778\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/951986-lufia_1_small.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-951986\"><img alt=\"The fortress of doom\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/951986-lufia_1_small.gif\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/951986-lufia_1_small.gif 180w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" data-width=\"180\"><\/a><figcaption>The fortress of doom<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Fast-forward into the future and the player is introduced to a mysterious girl named Lufia, as well as the nameless Hero of the story who also happens to be a descendant of Maxim.

The player moves the characters around a world map entering towns and other various places where they can talk to people, collect items, buy equipment, and perform tasks to aid them in their overall mission of saving the world. Characters become stronger by leveling up when they earn enough experience through winning battles, which in turn unlocks new abilities and boosts several attributes.<\/p><p>Battles occur randomly in hostile areas or in certain situations where it's part of the story such as a boss encounter. When a battle does occur, the player is taken to a turn-based battle screen where they have several options to choose from: attack, magic, item, defend, and run. Battles are similar to traditional RPG games; however, there is an actual strategy involved where the player must keep track of enemy hit points because if they don't they may end up wasting turns doing an \u201coverkill\u201d. For instance, if an enemy dies at the hands of Aguro and is still targeted that same turn by Lufia, Lufia still attacks that spot even though the enemy is dead, resulting in a miss.<\/p><p> <\/p>","id":2516,"name":"Lufia & the Fortress of Doom","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/lufia-the-fortress-of-doom\/3030-2516\/"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>Super Scope 6 (known in Europe as Nintendo Scope 6) is a minigame collection developed by <a href=\"\/nintendo-rd1\/3010-928\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-928\">Nintendo's R&amp;D1 division<\/a> and published by <a href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo<\/a> for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on February 1992.

It contains many aspects similar to such games as <a href=\"\/super-metroid\/3030-8292\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8292\">Super Metroid<\/a> and <a href=\"\/bionic-commando\/3030-7860\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7860\">Bionic Commando<\/a>. However, Phantom 2040 does have entirely unique gameplay mechanics as well. Phantom 2040 differs one way in that upgrading weapons is completely optional (unlike in Super Metroid, where there are set weapons and upgrades). Phantom 2040 also contains choices akin to moral choices (although based more on which direction to go).<\/p><p>Phantom 2040 also focuses heavily on exploration (a key factor in Super Metroid). The player does not have to go a set way, for a set distance as in some games, but rather has each level to explore either direction, locating the objective. Most areas contain secret upgrades or health boosting items. Some levels even have gates that must be remotely unlocked via a corresponding number (each door has a number). Unlike in Super Metroid, most of the exploration is optional, as it veers off of the game's main objective. Most of the areas can be revisited later for more exploration.<\/p><p>The game takes place across seven chapters, some of which are split into varying paths (of which the player has a choice). Each chapter takes the player to a completely new location. Depending on what decisions the player makes in the stages that a decision is available, some stages might not become available while others do. This means that the game has very many endings (over twenty unique endings). Some of these endings, however, aren't considered \"winning\" endings, and rather prompt the player to try again.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13636\/614088-phantom_2040_00003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614088\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13636\/614088-phantom_2040_00003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614088\"><img alt=\"Rebbeca Madison is trying to take over the world; it's up to Phantom to stop her.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13636\/614088-phantom_2040_00003.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13636\/614088-phantom_2040_00003.jpg 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Rebbeca Madison is trying to take over the world; it's up to Phantom to stop her.\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13636\/614088-phantom_2040_00003.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13636\/614088-phantom_2040_00003.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Rebbeca Madison is trying to take over the world; it's up to Phantom to stop her.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>It is the year 2040.

The player has two basic attack buttons: punch and kick. The third button is a \"utility\" button which can allow the player to do stronger punches and kicks (when combined with the punch or kick buttons), throws, and walljumps. The fourth button is a taunting button. Not every character can perform throws and walljumps. This game also features dashing forwards and backwards by pressing the joystick in either direction twice. Fireballs can be canceled out using punches or kicks.<\/p><p>The game also features a \"spirit gauge\", which controls when the player can perform special and super moves. The gauge lowers after the player performs a special\/super move. The more powerful the move, the more the gauge depletes. The gauge also depletes when the opponent performs a taunt. The gauge can only be recharged manually by holding down either the punch or kick button. It will be in one of three colors (green, yellow, or red) depending on the amount left.<\/p><p>Only Ryo and Robert have super (the Haou Shou Ken) and \"desperation\" (Ryuko Ranbou) moves that can only be learned through a special bonus stage. Both moves take up much of the spirit gauge, but the desperation move can only be performed when the player has 20% life or less (as indicated by a flashing life bar).<\/p><p>In single-player Story mode, the player is usually at a disadvantage with shorter life and spirit gauges. These can be increased in special bonus stages, where the player must perform a certain task (careful button pressing or button mashing).<\/p><h2>Characters<\/h2><ul><li><a href=\"\/ryo-sakazaki\/3005-3490\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3490\"> Ryo Sakazaki<\/a> (playable in one-player story mode)<\/li><li><a href=\"\/robert-garcia\/3005-111\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-111\"> Robert Garcia<\/a> (playable in one-player story mode)<\/li><li><a href=\"\/todoh\/3005-4485\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4485\"> Ryuhaku Todoh<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/jack-turner\/3005-16050\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16050\"> Jack Turner<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/lee-pai-long\/3005-4429\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4429\"> Lee Pai Long<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/king\/3005-4363\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4363\"> King<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/mickey-rogers\/3005-4414\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4414\"> Mickey Rogers<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/john-crawley\/3005-4415\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4415\"> John Crawley<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/mr-big\/3005-2040\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2040\"> Mr. Big<\/a> (only playable in two-player battle mode by either reaching the final stage and then letting another player join in or via cheat code)<\/li><li><a href=\"\/takuma-sakazaki\/3005-3389\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3389\"> Mr. Karate<\/a> (only playable in two-player battle mode by either reaching the final stage and then letting another player join in or via cheat code)<\/li><\/ul>","id":2760,"name":"Art of Fighting","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/art-of-fighting\/3030-2760\/"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>The <a href=\"\/arcade\/3045-84\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade <\/a>version is famous for using a boxing glove, instead of the classic controller.

In this prequel to the other <a href=\"\/mario\/3025-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1\">Mario titles<\/a>, players no longer control Mario; instead, they control Mario's green side-kick, <a href=\"\/yoshi\/3005-700\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-700\">Yoshi<\/a>. Mario himself is in the game and always with Yoshi, but it's not the plumber that players had grown used to; instead Mario returns as a baby, riding on Yoshi's back as Yoshi journeys through various levels on his way to Baby <a href=\"\/bowser\/3005-337\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser<\/a>'s castle to save Mario's brother <a href=\"\/luigi\/3005-370\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi<\/a>. Not only did this represent a major shift for the Super Mario series, it also marked a shift in visual design as well. Yoshi's Island used much more colorful palettes than other titles and appears much more stylized. Most objects and environments have much bolder lines and larger contrasts in colors, which gives itself a much more artistic, childish, and hand-drawn feel. Yoshi's Island was originally released on the <a href=\"\/snes\/3045-9\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo.<\/a><\/p><p>In 2002, Yoshi's Island was re-released on the <a href=\"\/game-boy-advance\/3045-4\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance<\/a> under the name Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3. Yoshi's Island received its first sequel in 2006 on the <a href=\"\/nintendo-ds\/3045-52\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS<\/a>, titled <a href=\"\/yoshis-island-ds\/3030-10347\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10347\">Yoshi's Island DS<\/a>. The story was a follow up to Yoshi's Island, though not a direct sequel, and not nearly as well received.<\/p><p>There are 6 different worlds in Yoshi's Island, each one with a different theme. World 1 is a field theme, World 2 has a forest theme, World 3 is a jungle, World 4 contains a variety of themes, World 5 has a snowy theme, and World 6 has a dystopic theme. World 6 is the final area of the game, where Yoshi faces off against <a href=\"\/kamek\/3005-1227\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1227\">Kamek<\/a> and <a href=\"\/baby-bowser\/3005-4566\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4566\">young Bowser.<\/a><\/p><p>Yoshi's Island was the first major Mario title that did not contain any form of a warp zone, allowing players to transport themselves further into the game. To complete Yoshi's Island, players were required to complete all of the game's 48 regular stages, though getting 100% completion was a much more daunting task with the many bonus levels featured in the title.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6246\/301504-yoshi4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-301504\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6246\/301504-yoshi4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-301504\"><img alt=\"The story begins\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6246\/301504-yoshi4.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6246\/301504-yoshi4.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"><\/a><figcaption>The story begins<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Our tale begins as a stork carries two peaceful young children over the tranquil ocean. All seems well, however, danger rears its ugly head as the evil magikoopa Kamek arrives, swiping Baby Luigi. He attempts to kidnap both infants, but fails, leaving baby Mario to plummet down into the ocean. Mario falls towards a small island in the great expanse of water, home of the Yoshis, an island called Yoshi's Island. Luckily for our young friend, he lands safely on the back of a bright green yoshi. Mario somehow makes Yoshi and his multi-colored friends aware of the catastrophe, and the entire tribe of dinosaurs enlists in the fight. Together, these yoshis will in turn carry Mario through dangerous terrain and, against all odds, rescue Baby Luigi and defeat Kamek. This is exactly what happens, as well. After a long, perilous journey across Yoshi's island's most threatening terrain whilst being pursued by Baby Bowser's minions, the Yoshi's arrive at Baby Bowser's castle. They fight with great strenght against both Bowser and Kamek, and come out the victors. Baby Mario and Luigi are both safe, and all is well in the world.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6246\/301508-yoshi7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-301508\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6246\/301508-yoshi7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-301508\"><img alt=\"Yoshi scrambling to get baby Mario back.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6246\/301508-yoshi7.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6246\/301508-yoshi7.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Yoshi scrambling to get baby Mario back.\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6246\/301508-yoshi7.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6246\/301508-yoshi7.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Yoshi scrambling to get baby Mario back.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Yoshi's Island introduces a plethora of new moves for Yoshi now that he has become the main character.

Throughout a level, the timer will refill back to the default 10 seconds, but a player can collect objects, such as bouncing starmen (not to be confused with ones from other Super Mario titles that provide invulnerability), that will increase the limit up to 30 seconds.<\/p><p>Hidden throughout each level are a number of extras which players can collect.

Yoshi can become a helicopter, letting him fly; a car, which increases his speed, but he must avoid enemies; a submarine, which lets him shoot torpedoes that home onto enemies; a train, which rides on rails, but must avoid other enemies also on the tracks; and a mole vehicle that can dig through certain obstacles. During any vehicle segment, players don't have to worry about losing Baby Mario, but still must complete the segment before the transformation wears off. When a player successfully reaches the end of the segment, Yoshi and Baby Mario are reunited and the level continues.<\/p><p>On a few rare occasions, Yoshi has a chance to nab a \"super star,\" altering Baby Mario into the 'Super Baby Mario' form, also causing Mario to don a cape. This marks a turn of events for the game where the player controls Baby Mario rather then his scaly chauffer. Baby Mario can run at the speed of light up walls and across ceilings and has an improved ability to jump and glide. Many times, Mario can nab hard-to-reach items and plenty of coins. This power up is seldom seen, and only lasts for a very short period of time, so make good use of it.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5891\/280138-super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island_snes_screenshot4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-280138\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5891\/280138-super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island_snes_screenshot4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-280138\"><img alt=\"A stage map where players pick the level they wish to play.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5891\/280138-super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island_snes_screenshot4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5891\/280138-super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island_snes_screenshot4.jpg 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A stage map where players pick the level they wish to play.\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5891\/280138-super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island_snes_screenshot4.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5891\/280138-super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island_snes_screenshot4.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A stage map where players pick the level they wish to play.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>At the end of each level, players jump through a goal hoop that will randomly reward the player with a mini-game.

It has fast-paced, gritty, old-school action. Contra III is the first game in the Contra series to allow the player to hold two weapons, making it a landmark title in the franchise. In addition to that change, the power of the Super Nintendo allowed for larger, more detailed sprites and much more complex level design. Players can now jump on bars and climb on them monkey-bar style, climb walls and ladders, destroy various objects (such as the car right in front of the player in the very first level), and vehicles (such as a tank in the first level). New levels include one in which the player must jump between missiles while destroying an enemy ship, riding on a motorcycle while speeding down a road, riding on a jet ski, and two <a href=\"\/mode-7\/3015-184\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-184\">Mode 7<\/a> top-down levels.<\/p><p>In the Mode 7 levels, the player controls the view using the two shoulder buttons (R and L). By pressing these buttons, the camera rotates around. At the start of the stage, the player gets to choose where to be dropped in. Navigating around the area and destroying various targets eventually leads the player to a boss, which must be disposed of in a fashion similar to the 2D side-scrolling bosses.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><p>If the Contra series has been known for anything, it's the wide variety of weapon power-ups available to the player. The letter next to each weapon in parenthesis detonates which lettered power-up awards the weapon to the player. By tapping the X button (standard controls), the player can swap between two weapon slots. If killed, only the weapon in the current slot will be taken away from the player as a penalty. Note that tapping X while shooting will rapidly switch weapons, allowing the player to fire anything twice as fast (within the physical limits of the player in question). Also, holding both shoulder buttons and pressing fire will result in a spinning attack with both equipped weapons being fired 360 degrees.<\/p><ol><li><b>Machine Gun (N\/A)<\/b> - The starting weapon of Contra III. Has a high rate of fire, but only shoots in one direction and has very low damage.<\/li><li><b>Spread Shot (S)<\/b> - Essentially the shotgun of the game. Fires out five weak shots that shoot out in five directions in front of the shooter. Excellent for clearing out crowds of foes and does good damage to bosses at close range. Not nearly as overpowered as in previous games in the series.<\/li><li><b>Homing Missiles (H)<\/b> - Weak missiles that seek out enemy targets.<\/li><li><b>Laser (L)<\/b> - A powerful gun that fires out one shot in side-scrolling levels, but turns into a continuous beam when in a top-down level. Takes down bosses with great speed.<\/li><li><b>Shield (B)<\/b> - Gives the player temporary invincibility to everything except for falling off the screen.<\/li><li><b>Bomb<\/b> <b>(has the appearance of a bomb)<\/b> - Sends out a circular wave of destruction that slowly spreads over the entire screen. Damages bosses and will instantly destroy most normal enemies. After each death, players will respawn with one bomb, and more can be obtained as weapon pickups.<\/li><li><b>Crush Missile (C)<\/b> - With the exception of the bomb, the strongest weapon in the game. It has short range, but incredible splash damage to compensate. When paired with another Crush Missile, it can take down bosses faster than any other weapon.<\/li><li><b>Flame (F)<\/b> - A flamethrower. Short range but can pass through barriers, making it ideal for certain situations. Also, when holding the fire button and switching the direction of fire, the flame will move in a waving pattern instead of snapping to the new direction like other weapons, providing a wider range of fire.<\/li><\/ol><h2>Mode 7<\/h2><p>Contra III: The Alien Wars made use of the <a href=\"\/mode-7\/3015-184\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-184\">Mode 7<\/a> graphics mode of the Super Nintendo throughout the game. An example of its use within the game is within the first stage as the low-flying plane which appears mid-stage forms part of the background layer and is animated using Mode 7 (as it comes towards the player its size increases while its wings bank slightly). The bombs which it drops however are sprites.<\/p><p>A second example would be the turtle boss at the end of the first stage which also sits in the background but its moving legs and the bullets that it fires are sprites.<\/p>","id":3016,"name":"Contra III: The Alien Wars","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/contra-iii-the-alien-wars\/3030-3016\/"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4395\/428070-nba_live_2.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-428070\" data-size=\"large\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4395\/428070-nba_live_2.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-428070\"><img alt=\"All New Play Calling\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4395\/428070-nba_live_2.gif\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4395\/428070-nba_live_2.gif 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"><\/a><figcaption>All New Play Calling<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>NBA Live '95 is the annual EA Sports NBA Live game for the 1994-95 season, released in late 1994 for PC, SNES and Genesis.

If hit in this way, Katt is guaranteed to <a href=\"\/counter-system\/3015-867\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-867\">counter-attack<\/a>. Her field ability is the same as Bow's, letting her participate in the hunting minigame. Unlike Bow, who shoots game from a distance, Katt swings her staff directly in front of her, and while her reach is therefore limited, she kills targets in a single swing.

His special combat ability, Wake, has him attacking a party member with a fraction of his usual strength. This damages them, but can also dispel status ailments like Sleep. Wake also has a chance, albeit a rather slim one, to resuscitate a KOed party member. His special field ability allows him to curl up into a ball and roll across the world map at a much faster speed than the party makes on foot.

Her wings are black (although they're clearly purple in-game and in most concept art), and a member of the royal family of Windia having black wings is such a bad omen that tradition demanded that the baby be put to death. Instead her mother the Queen arranged for Nina to be smuggled out of the country, though while she lives, the royal family refuses to officially acknowledge her as a princess. Nina develops feelings for Ryu after he saves her from the Joker gang, and becomes the other love interest. Her weapon is a magic ring that shoots bolts of energy, though as an offensive magic specialist, she almost never has to use it. Her special combat ability is Will, which functions much the same as Ryu's Guts, except that instead of restoring Nina's HP, it restores her AP (ability points). Her special field ability makes the party impervious to pit traps; if Nina is at the front of the party, and they fall into a hole, Nina will immediately fly the party back up using her wings. Later in the game, Nina also gains the ability to summon the Great Bird of Windia, which can fly the party around the world.<\/p><h3>Sten<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958872-bof2_sten.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958872\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0576923076923\" data-width=\"520\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:105.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958872-bof2_sten.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958872\"><img alt=\"Sten\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\" data-width=\"605\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958872-bof2_sten.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958872-bof2_sten.jpg 520w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sten\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958872-bof2_sten.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958872-bof2_sten.jpg 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\" data-width=\"605\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Sten<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>A once proud Highland warrior, he left his home voluntarily after a great war, now he performs magic tricks on the street to stay alive.

However, since he isn't as strong as Ryu, fast as Katt, or tough as Rand, Sten gets sidelined by most players. His special combat ability, RIP, allows him to play dead, which means he cannot be targeted by enemies, although he still makes a regular attack against an enemy of the player's choice. However, if Sten is the last member left standing and he tries to use RIP, the enemy will target him anyway and he'll take more damage than usual. His field ability lets the party cross certain narrow cliff faces by having Sten reach across with his long Highlander arms. This is only story-necessary a few times, but several areas have optional shortcuts that Sten can access in this way.<\/p><h3>Jean<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958873-bof2_jean.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958873\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.71212121212121\" data-width=\"660\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 660px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958873-bof2_jean.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958873\"><img alt=\"Jean\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/18591\/958873-bof2_jean.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958873-bof2_jean.jpg 660w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/18591\/958873-bof2_jean.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/18591\/958873-bof2_jean.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jean\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/18591\/958873-bof2_jean.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958873-bof2_jean.jpg 660w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/18591\/958873-bof2_jean.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/18591\/958873-bof2_jean.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Jean<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Full name \"Ekaru Hoppe de pe Jean\".

While Jean's noble spirit sees him through in the storyline, his stats are all garbage except for luck, so he is rarely used in battle. His special combat ability, Jab, has him attack all enemies at once, but he does much less damage per enemy than he would with a regular attack, which isn't that much anyway. His field ability lets him transform into a giant (non-anthropomorphic) frog, and carry the group around the map. This is partially useful because he moves two spaces with every hop, so the chance of random battles is halved, but mainly because he can swim like this, and get the party across land-locked bodies of water (the ocean being too rough for a mere frog).<\/p><h3>Spar<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958874-bof2_spar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958874\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2826086956522\" data-width=\"460\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 460px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958874-bof2_spar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958874\"><img alt=\"Spar\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\" data-width=\"498\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958874-bof2_spar.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958874-bof2_spar.jpg 460w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spar\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958874-bof2_spar.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958874-bof2_spar.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\" data-width=\"498\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Spar<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>A Grass Man who is held captive in a circus cage.

His special combat ability, Nature (rendered as \"Ntre\" due to the game's absurd four-character limit), allows him to call upon the strength of a mysterious nature spirit named Green. If Green responds (and he often doesn't), it will have a magical effect on the battle that depends on the background; if the party is in the desert, nearby cacti will suddenly explode and damage the enemy, or if the party is in an open field, flowers may bloom and release pollen that lowers the enemies' defence, etc. It cannot work in areas without plantlife such as caves or manmade areas.

She can be re-recruited if her secret home in the desert is found, and if the player speaks to her spirit guardians. She is in fact disguised as a human at the Magic School in Hometown, and if spoken to after the player meets her guardians, she will drop her disguise and forcefully join the party. Her weapon, just as it was in the original game, is a <a href=\"\/magic-staff\/3055-535\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-535\">magical rod<\/a>, though she should rely on her powerful offensive magic instead, which is slightly stronger than even Nina's. While characters in the original Breath of Fire didn't have special combat abilities, here she's gained one called Shed, in which she sheds her skin, which restores her HP to maximum and dispels negative status ailments, although it lowers her defense. As per her status as a secret character, unlike Ryu's Guts or Nina's Will, Shed works perfectly 100% of the time. Bleu, like Bow and Katt, can participate in the hunting minigame through her special field ability, though hers is literally a joke; she lifts her rod, casts a fire spell, and instantly incinerates all creatures on screen. This would seem to be handy except that instead of leaving behind useful meat, all creatures killed in this manner drop useless charcoal.<\/p><h2>Other Characters<\/h2><p>People who Ryu meets along the way who do not join the party.<\/p><h3>Ganer<\/h3><p>Ryu and Yua's father.

Heavily implied to be Ryu's sister Yua, all grown up.<\/p><h3>Valerie<\/h3><p>Ryu and Yua's absent mother, and a member of the Dragon Clan. She was believed to have died protecting the village from an attack, but eventually Ryu finds out the truth.<\/p><h3>Princess Mina<\/h3><p>Nina's younger sister, and the only member of her family that still acknowledges Nina's existence.

An occasional ally to the group.<\/p><h2>Shamans and Fusion<\/h2><p>During the course of the game the player will be able to seek out Shamans. These (mostly) lovely women will be able to fuse with the party characters and improve their stats. It can also drastically change the characters' appearance as well. Ryu cannot form any Fusions at all, because as a member of the Dragon Clan, he is incompatible with their magic. However, the first time they attempt to fuse with him, they unlock his inherited ability to transform into a dragon. Bleu is also immune to Fusion, but this is likely just because she is a secret character.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958888-bof2_shaman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958888\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.47959183673469\" data-width=\"980\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 980px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958888-bof2_shaman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958888\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/18591\/958888-bof2_shaman.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958888-bof2_shaman.jpg 980w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/18591\/958888-bof2_shaman.jpg 960w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/18591\/958888-bof2_shaman.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/18591\/958888-bof2_shaman.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/18591\/958888-bof2_shaman.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18591\/958888-bof2_shaman.jpg 980w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/18591\/958888-bof2_shaman.jpg 960w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/18591\/958888-bof2_shaman.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/18591\/958888-bof2_shaman.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>The Shamans from left to right are:<\/p><p>Solo (Shaman of Earth), Seny (Holy Shaman), Shin (Devil Shaman), Seso (Shaman Of Water), Sana (Shaman of Fire), Spoo (Shaman of Wind),<\/p><h3>Fusion<\/h3><p>When mixing certain Shamans with the party characters, sometimes they will drastically change:<\/p><ul><li>Nina x Seny x Spoo = Angelic Nina<\/li><li>Jean x Seny = Dark Prince Jean<\/li><li>Katt x Shin = Dark Martial Artist Katt<\/li><li>Sten x Sana x Spoo = Sten Jinni<\/li><li>Rand x Solo x Sana = Small and Cute Rand<\/li><li>Bow x Seny x Shin = Robo-Bow<\/li><li>Spar x Seso = Girly Spar<\/li><li>Spar x Sana x Shin = Snapdragon Spar<\/li><li>Spar x Solo = Spar Sprout<\/li><\/ul>","id":3093,"name":"Breath of Fire II","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/breath-of-fire-ii\/3030-3093\/"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>Panic Bomber, or Tobidase!

It was developed in the UK by Gremlin Interactive and published by Gremlin in their home territory, and by Kemco everywhere else. The game was released early 1995.<\/p><p>It balances the racing of Top Gear with some more futuristic settings and concepts. It also added weapons to the Top Gear series for the first time, which can be acquired by purchasing them along with sci-fi upgrades like a nuclear fusion engines or warp devices.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p>Set in the year 3000 and organized by an anonymous race or individual. The competition starts far away from Earth, on alien planets on the other side of the galaxy. Below is the text from the introduction of the game:<\/p><blockquote><p>\u201cOnce every millennium, one of the greatest events in the galaxy begins... It is a race. A car race. It starts at the furthest reaches of the galaxy and ends at the center. For the winner riches beyond belief. Knowledge of the race is passed from generation to generation. The identity of the organizer has been lost through the mists of the time. Or maybe it has never been known. But even the youngest child knows on a certain date... all he has to do is look to the skies... for a sign. The time has arrived. YOU are in the race. GOOD LUCK\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>In all, there are 48 different tracks, with varying environments throughout the game. Cars can be upgraded before a race and the settings are more extensive than in previous versions of Top Gear. The player can set armor combinations on the vehicle to help protect it, as well as alter the paint job, change the gear configuration, set boost settings and modify and enhance the engine. Weapons are also featured throughout the game, used best for defensive purposes.<\/p><p>One of the prime features of the game is the use of the Super Nintendo multi-tap allowing up to four players to play the game simultaneously. The screen is split four ways and if there are fewer than four players, AI opponents will fill up the remaining places. The game features Championship and VS modes. The Championship mode has the option for one-player full screen and two-player split screen. The multiplayer game has two-, three- and four-player options.<\/p><h2>Reception<\/h2><p>On its release it received mixed ratings.

At the beginning of each age, the player's creature changes drastically to a new form, becoming rather weak. Over the process of each age, defeated enemies drop \"<a data-ref-id=\"3055-267\" href=\"\/meat\/3055-267\/\">meat<\/a>\" which can be eaten to regain <a data-ref-id=\"3015-130\" href=\"\/health\/3015-130\/\">health<\/a> and gain EVO points. These EVO points can be spent to upgrade various parts of the body, with each part having several options to choose from. Each potential evolution has a required amount of EVO points to purchase, and is gained immediately when points are spent.<\/p><p>Body parts that can be evolved include:<\/p><ul><li>Jaws<\/li><li>Horns<\/li><li>Neck<\/li><li>Body<\/li><li>Hands and Feet<\/li><li>Dorsal Fin<\/li><li>Tail<\/li><li>Back of the Head<\/li><\/ul><p>Upgrades to each of these body parts give a variety of changes to the abilities of the player, from attack damage to health and defense. Each time that a large, story-related evolution is reached, however, all minor evolutions are lost and new ones must be purchased. The evolutions do not follow any set order, allowing the player to upgrade any part of the body to deal with an immediate threat or obstacle.<\/p><h3>Sales and critical reception<\/h3><p>The game was not released to much fanfare, but has generally been recognized as a work of high quality and became something a cult favorite years later.<\/p><p>Its fusion of side-scrolling and RPG gameplay was too repetitive for some, as players who enjoy the side-scrolling genre may not have been interested in the amount of character development normally associated with an RPG. Those willing to endure the occasional grind, however, appreciate the game's unique subject matter and use of evolution as a gamplay device.<\/p>","id":3397,"name":"E. V.

The game introduced the Shadow Force and Cyclone Force, both of which featured new weapon sets and special enhancements. R-Type III also made a number of enhancements to the weapons and charging systems. The game saw a return to the red-blue-yellow weapon system, as well as replacing the Diffuse Wave Cannon to a standard wave cannon that upon charging shoots a massive beam that clears the entire screen. R-Type III also saw the inclusion of a new cannon, the Hyper Wave Cannon. The only way to access this cannon was to enter Hyper mode and then charge the standard cannon fully. The Hyper Wave Cannon acts like the standard cannon except with rapid fire ability. Also when the cannon is in use, any Bits that the player has collected will spin around the ship during damage to any enemy that draws near.

It features all new Standing Tanks (STs) are antagonists and is based around a tournament to the death known as The Battle Game. Anubis is once again the villain, returning in his near-indomitable ST Thanatos.<\/p><p>Like its predecessor, the game features one-on-one fights with other STs and their occupants. The player's ST (the Falcon) is driven by Mike Anderson, an NPC character, and so it'll automatically follow the opponent ST as it moves around. This allows the player character to only have to concern themselves with the ST's weapons.<\/p><p>The game is one of a handful of titles to support the <a href=\"\/super-scope\/3000-12\/\" data-ref-id=\"3000-12\">Super Scope<\/a> peripheral for the SNES.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Each fight requires that the player wear down the enemy ST's health bar. There's usually several ways to do this, but the goal is often to find the quickest and most damaging means to take down the opponent before they can do to the same to the player's ST. This involves exploiting weak points, building up the energy bar for powerful targeted shots, using the limited supply of bombs and intercepting the enemy's shots to mitigate damage intake. <\/p><p>Due to the game's combat heavy nature, accuracy is important. To help compensate for potential issues sensor alignment or bad TV placement, the game follows its title screen with a gun calibration to ensure the player can correctly aim from their position.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Gameplay Modes<\/h2><p> <\/p><h3>Single Player<\/h3><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p><b>Battle Game <\/b><\/p><p>The Battle Game is effectively Metal Combat's campaign mode, which pits players in their ST Falcon (or Tornado if a cheat code is entered) against the top ST combatants of various regions of Earth. After all of Earth's top combatants are defeated, the player will move on to space to fight the Battle Game ruler Thanatos. What they will instead find, are plot twists abound.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Players engage in combat with enemies in a one on one setting, using the Super Scope to fire on their opponents. The player's ST is capable of firing very weak rapid shots (typically used defensively to shoot down enemy projectiles), and charged shots of varying power depending on how long the shot is charged for. The most powerful charged shot available to the player is the Treble Shot, which can be used to cause massive damage to enemy weak points, as well as wipe most enemy projectiles off the screen in a single shot.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Aside from the basic rapid and charged shots, the player can also acquire special one-use power ups. At the end of each battle, the player will be rewarded with a bomb (which carries over to the next fight), and at the end of most battles the player will be upgraded with a special single shot power (such as a temporary shield, or a power boost). Players may hold a maximum of five bombs, and as many special items as they'd like, although they can only bring two special items into battle (bombs must be brought into battle and are automatically added to the players weapon list).<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Each opponent ST that the player faces will have a weak point of some kind. These weak points can be found in one of two ways, depending on the enemy: The enemy ST will either perform an action that will cause the weak spot to glow and be given away, or, the player can fire a treble shot at the enemy and expose their weak point. Typically hitting a weak point with a treble shot will destroy that area on the enemy ST. However, because some weak points can only be exposed with a treble shot, the only possible follow up is to hit the spot with a weaker charged shot.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Other individual parts of an enemy ST, such as the arms or legs, can be destroyed, allowing the player to cripple an enemy part by part. Rather then be adversely effected by losing parts, some enemies will simply fire powerful shots from their missing parts, making this a sometimes risky tactic.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>A cheat code may be entered at the title screen to unlock access to a second ST, named Tornado. Tornado's weapon systems charge shots much more rapidly at the cost of needing to charge ten times before firing a treble shot (or in this case, more of a decible shot). The ST Tornado also has a much lower defense in exchange for this offensive power. In addition to combat changes, some areas of the plot are changed to accommodate the new ST and pilot.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><b>Time Trials<\/b><\/p><p> <\/p><p>In Time Trials, the player selects their difficulty level (Low, Medium, or High), which determines the three opponents they will face during the time trial. The player then fights the three opponents for the difficulty level they have selected, and at the end receive a cumulative fight time. In each fight, the player is given a single bomb, and no special power ups. If the player's ST is destroyed during a fight, their time of defeat is kept should they decide to continue, and is added to their total fight time when the level is subsequently finished.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><b>Training Mode<\/b><\/p><p> <\/p><p>Training Mode allows the player to replay each ST's respective tutorial missions from the start of the game.<\/p><p> <\/p><h3>Multiplayer<\/h3><p> <\/p><p><b>Combat Game<\/b><\/p><p> <\/p><p>Combat Game allows for two player combat; one player uses the SNES Control Pad to control an enemy ST of their choosing, while another player uses the super scope to fight them like a normal enemy.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Using the XYAB buttons, the control pad player can use one of four attacks in their ST's arsenal, and using the D-Pad they can control the movement of the battle. Like single player CPU battles, the control pad ST can be crippled and has weak points. The last player with health remaining wins.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><b>Time Trials<\/b><\/p><p> <\/p><p>Multiplayer Time Trials play exactly the same as single player time trials, with the exception being that both players are given a chance at defeating each enemy. At the end of three rounds, a cumulative time is totaled for each player, and the player with the lower time wins.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Battle Game Opponents<\/h2><p>On their way to save humanity, the players will encounter a colorful cast of STs and pilots.

One of many games developed for the franchise on the Super Famicom platform, it is the only one out of those not directly based on any particular season of the anime television show. As the name suggests, the game presents itself as a side story. Though it does feature cameos and references involving characters from seasons one and two, the events in this game aren't tied to Sailor Moon canon. Like many games in the series, it was never localized or ported to any other platform. This led to a community effort to create a successful fan translation of the game for the use in software emulation.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Another Story fits the build as a Japanese RPG. Random encounters and turn-based battles give it that playing field of SNES era games such as <a href=\"\/final-fantasy\/3025-194\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-194\"> Final Fantasy<\/a>. An interesting twist on combat was the ability to combine the abilities of any two Sailor Scouts to pull of devastating attacks using each characters' signature moves taken directly from the show, similar to the combo system of <a href=\"\/chrono-trigger\/3030-9249\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9249\"> Chrono Trigger<\/a>.<\/p><p>When the player isn't in battle, Another Story features a 2D world to explore with non-playable characters around to talk to.

The player can select between seven scenarios and play through them in any order. Each has a different protagonist and is set in a different time period, but is linked by the same omnipresent evil: an entity known as Odio, which manifests in different forms in each of the scenarios. After all seven are complete, the game moves to the final two chapters.<\/p><p>Live A Live was never released outside of Japan. It remains a Super Famicom exclusive.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p>Live A Live plays out over several chapters, each with a unique protagonist and subsequent story, and all set during different time periods. For the final chapter, all of the characters from the previous chapters join forces to fight against Odio.<\/p><h3>Prehistoric Chapter (Contact)<\/h3><p>Pogo is the main character during this chapter, and has stats that mostly focus on physical attacks and defense. His best friend, Gori the ape, helps him save the lovely Beru from the dinosaur O-D-O. This chapter is set in a land before language, so the player has to find different ways of communicating with the other NPCs.<\/p><h3>Bakumatsu Chapter (Secret Orders)<\/h3><p>Set in a war-fraught Japan, the main protagonist is the ninja Oboro, a well rounded character in both defense and offense. Along with a veritable carbon copy of himself named Circle, and a fellow prisoner, he fights against a powerful tyrant named Odelou. Oboro can opt to kill every resident of the castle he is sent to, or kill absolutely no-one. Different rewards are given for both.<\/p><h3>Kung Fu Chapter (Inheritance)<\/h3><p>The three main characters; Samo, Lei, and Yun, are all training under the Kung Fu master, Ro. One day, their dojo is attacked by ninjas, which are led by the evil Odiwan Lee. Two of Ro's apprentices are killed, and the remaining character helps Ro kill Odiwan Lee. The apprentice is the character to move onto the finale.<\/p><h3>Old West Chapter (Wandering)<\/h3><p>Sunset, the main protagonist during this chapter, is an outlaw running from a bounty hunter named Maddog. After being jumped by a few members of the local gang called the Crazy Bunch and killing both of them, Sunset and Maddog team up to fight off the inevitable counter attack by the rest of the gang. After a long fight, the leader of the Crazy bunch, O. Dio, attacks them. Sunset and Maddog both defeat O. Dio in the end. The player can make the final battle easier by removing gang members ahead of time by working with the townsfolk to set up traps and ambushes.<\/p><h3>Present Chapter (The Strongest)<\/h3><p>During the present time, the main protagonist, Masaru, enters a tournament in order to learn many different techniques and become the best fighter in the world. After several boss fights, the final fight between Masaru and the mysterious Odie Olbright decides the world's strongest fighter. The player can prolong each battle until they are hit by the opponent's special technique, which they can learn and use in future battles.<\/p><h3>Near Future Chapter (Flow)<\/h3><p>There are three main characters during this time period: Taro, Akira, and Matsu. Akira finds out that the government is trying to summon a god named Odeo by melting everyone on Earth. Akira learns how to control a robot to fight against Odeo. This chapter switches its combat between fighting as Akira on-foot and in the enormous mech Buriki Daioh. <\/p><h3>Science Fiction Chapter (Mechanical Heart)<\/h3><p>The main protagonist is a spherical helper robot named Cube. He investigates the ship after a series of unusual accidents kill the crewmembers one by one. It and the surviving crewmembers discover that the computer's AI entity 0D-10 is the culprit. He is defeated by the main character hacking the video game in the ship's lounge. The weaponless Cube cannot physically attack the <a href=\"\/behemoth\/3015-4280\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4280\">behemoth<\/a>-like creature prowling the spaceship, and must find ways to outwit or evade it to move around.<\/p><h3>Medieval Chapter (King of Demons)<\/h3><p>This chapter is unlocked after the player completes all the other chapters. It focuses on a knight named Oersted, who is tasked with rescuing the princess of the kingdom of Lucretia, who also happens to be his fiancee, from the clutches of the Demon Lord. Joining him include his best friend Straybow, a wizard; Hash, a knight who previously defeated the Demon Lord; and Uranus, a priest. Towards the end of the chapter, things take a turn for the worse, and a string of events causes Oersted to sacrifice his soul to become the next Demon Lord, renaming himself Odio in the process.<\/p><h3>Final Chapter<\/h3><p>This chapter is unlocked after the player completes the Medieval Chapter. There are four ways this chapter plays out, depending on which character the player chooses to be the protagonist and a number of different variables.<\/p>","id":3570,"name":"Live a Live","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/live-a-live\/3030-3570\/"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/86598\/1311859-62202501__1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1311859\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3223529411765\" data-width=\"850\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 850px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:132.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/86598\/1311859-62202501__1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1311859\"><img alt=\"Advertisement featuring four of the new playable characters\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/86598\/1311859-62202501__1_.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/86598\/1311859-62202501__1_.jpg 850w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/86598\/1311859-62202501__1_.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/86598\/1311859-62202501__1_.jpg 483w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px\" data-width=\"483\"><\/a><figcaption>Advertisement featuring four of the new playable characters<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Mortal Kombat II is a 2D fighting game developed and released by <a href=\"\/midway\/3010-185\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-185\">Midway<\/a> in 1993 for arcades.

The game introduces more easter eggs, including a playable version of <a href=\"\/pong\/3030-22195\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22195\">Pong<\/a> and the iconic <a href=\"\/dan-forden\/3040-11103\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-11103\">\"Toasty!\"<\/a> sound clip. The score system from the original (as well as the <a href=\"\/test-your-might\/3015-1454\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1454\">Test Your Might!<\/a> minigame and endurance matches) has been removed in favor of a tally system that tracks the number of consecutive matches won.<\/p><p>Taking place sometime after the events of the last Mortal Kombat tournament, the story shifts the location to an alternate realm called <a href=\"\/outworld\/3035-23\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-23\">Outworld<\/a>, where it's emperor, <a href=\"\/shao-kahn\/3005-91\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-91\">Shao Kahn<\/a>, plans to take over <a href=\"\/earth\/3035-65\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-65\">Earthrealm<\/a> by defeating the warriors of Earth in a tournament (with the help of his half-tiger, half-human bodyguard, <a href=\"\/kintaro\/3005-205\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-205\">Kintaro<\/a>, and the restored <a href=\"\/shang-tsung\/3005-92\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-92\">Shang Tsung<\/a>).

Three stages have special Stage Fatalities: The Dead Pool, The Kombat Tomb, and The Pit II. Unlike the original Mortal Kombat (where the Stage Fatality is done with a simple uppercut), Stage Fatalities must be performed with a unique button combination. The button combination for both The Kombat Tomb and The Pit II are unique for each character, with the button combination for The Dead Pool being universal for all characters.<\/p><p>Mortal Kombat II introduces two alternate types of finishing moves: <a href=\"\/babality\/3015-2081\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2081\">Babalities<\/a> and <a href=\"\/friendship\/3015-2084\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2084\">Friendships<\/a>. Babalities humiliate the opponent by turning their character into a <a href=\"\/baby\/3015-3208\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3208\">baby<\/a>, while Friendships makes the character show a friendly gesture (from <a href=\"\/johnny-cage\/3005-224\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-224\">autographing a picture<\/a> to <a href=\"\/baraka\/3005-64\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-64\">giving a gift<\/a>).

Soccer Kid uses his soccerball to attack enemies, and is able to control it and send it flying in different directions.

The game was touted as a simplified role-playing game for entry level players. This was done to appeal to people not familiar with the role playing genre, so they could then \"graduate\" to Squaresoft's other RPGs like Final Fantasy IV or the then-upcoming Secret of Mana. The game was eventually released in its native Japan the following year with the title Final Fantasy USA: Mystic Quest.<\/p><p>The game begins with the player controlling a young adult named Benjamin during an adventure to reclaim stolen crystals that represented the world's elemental powers. Unlike most of the <a href=\"\/square-co-ltd\/3010-6323\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6323\">Squaresoft<\/a> RPGs of the time, there are no <a href=\"\/save-point\/3015-51\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-51\">save points<\/a>; players are allowed to save at any time. Party size is limited to two with Benjamin and a secondary character slot that rotates as the story progresses. In place of <a href=\"\/random-encounter\/3015-123\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">random battles<\/a>, the player is able to see enemies on the field without the need of an item until a specific point in the game, but all enemies are stationary and incapable of roaming. Also unlike most RPGs, players are not allowed to free roam the world map, making the gameplay mostly <a href=\"\/linear-gameplay\/3015-383\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-383\">linear<\/a>. The player is required to follow guided paths, some of which could be blocked off until tasks are completed. Characters can <a href=\"\/jump\/3015-379\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-379\">jump<\/a>, and use weapons outside of battle lending it an action-adventure type of gameplay also not found in other Final Fantasies. Mystic Quest includes many puzzles during the gameplay. Mystic Quest does not have the tradition of <a href=\"\/random-encounter\/3015-123\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">random enemies<\/a> like the rest of the Final Fantasy franchise, instead the player battles stationary enemies within dungeons. The player has the choice whether to attack the enemy or not, and can prepare beforehand with restorative items. The battle screen appears after approaching an enemy, turns are awarded back and forth with the fastest character getting the most turns. Players can battle, run, or \"control\" during the battle menu. Control can allow the player to manually control their allies or have the CPU control them. Battle is influenced by statistics like speed, accuracy, or attacking power. Characters gain <a href=\"\/experience-points\/3015-39\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience points<\/a> and gold pieces from winning battles. The game also includes battlefields that the player can enter and attempt to clear out ten battles against pre-set enemy encounters which rewards the player with a large cash prize or even a unique item.<\/p><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1741940-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1741940\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.89820359281437\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.8%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1741940-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1741940\"><img alt=\" Soundtrack cover \" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4527\/1741940-1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1741940-1.jpg 668w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4527\/1741940-1.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4527\/1741940-1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption> Soundtrack cover <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Soundtrack for Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was composed by Yasuhiro Kawakami and Ryuji Sasai.<\/p><p>01 - MYSTIC RE-QUEST I<\/p><p>02 - MYSTIC RE-QUEST II<\/p><p>03 - Mystic Quest<\/p><p>04 - Hill of Fate<\/p><p>05 - World<\/p><p>06 - Beautiful Forest<\/p><p>07 - Battle 1<\/p><p>08 - Victory Fanfare<\/p><p>09 - City of Forest<\/p><p>10 - Fossil Labyrinth<\/p><p>11 - Battle 2<\/p><p>12 - Middle Tower<\/p><p>13 - Shrine of Light<\/p><p>14 - Rock Theme<\/p><p>15 - Fanfare of Friendship<\/p><p>16 - Dungeon of Ice<\/p><p>17 - Dungeon of Waterfall<\/p><p>18 - City of Fire - Faeria<\/p><p>19 - Rock 'n' Roll<\/p><p>20 - Lava Dome<\/p><p>21 - City of Wind - Windaria<\/p><p>22 - Mountain Range of Whirlwinds<\/p><p>23 - The Crystal<\/p><p>24 - Last Castle<\/p><p>25 - Battle 3<\/p><p>26 - Mystic Ballad<\/p><p>27 - Ending<\/p><p>28 - RE-MIXTIC QUEST<\/p>","id":3638,"name":"Final Fantasy Mystic Quest","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/final-fantasy-mystic-quest\/3030-3638\/"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>Animaniacs is a platforming game released by <a href=\"\/konami-corporation\/3010-87\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-87\">Konami<\/a> on the <a href=\"\/snes\/3045-9\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES<\/a> and <a href=\"\/genesis\/3045-6\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Genesis<\/a> consoles.

Drawing inspiration from two board games, <em>Civilization<\/em> from Avalon Hill and <em>Risk<\/em>, and two recently released computer games, <a href=\"\/populous\/3030-6210\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6210\"> Populous<\/a> and <a href=\"\/simcity\/3030-37620\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37620\"> SimCity<\/a>, Meier set to work with Bruce Shelley on Civilization.<\/p><p>While the game would see release via MicroProse, and Meier was a co-founder of the company, at the time of Civilization's creation, Meier was not an employee of MicroProse. Meier's former MicroProse partner, Bill Stealey, had changed the direction of the company away from PC games and into the home console and arcade market. Meier jumped ship prior to MicroProse going public.<\/p><p>Inspired by their work on Railroad Tycoon, a deviation from their normal flight combat and military strategy games, Meier and Shelley began programming Civilization on an IBM PC in 1990. This began soon after MicroProse cancelled the sequel to <a href=\"\/railroad-tycoon\/3025-416\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-416\"> Railroad Tycoon<\/a>. Meier personally handled all the programming and coding and all of the art for early incarnations of the game. The game became an all-consuming project, and Meier kept a notepad near his bed in case of sudden inspiration.<\/p><p>Development occurred in cycles. Meier would develop a functioning prototype, hand it over to Shelley and they would dissect it until Meier went back to programming. The partners were the only ones involved in the early design process, with Meier unwilling to involve any other people until he was ready.<\/p><p>An early incarnation of the game drew heavily from the duo's work on Railroad Tycoon and was equally inspired by SimCity. It was originally real-time based on zoning: players would choose areas for specific purposes and watch as their civilization slowly grew.<\/p><p>At this moment in time, development was halted. Stealey, a former pilot, had developed MicroProse on the strength of flight simulators, and had little interest in other games. He was not particularly happy with the release of Railroad Tycoon, and Civilization would never had gotten so far if it were not for the previous game's success. Meier's status as a contractor, as opposed to employee, allowed the development of Civilization to continue. However, Stealey stepped in and refused to back the game, unless Meier and Shelley finished <a href=\"\/sid-meiers-covert-action\/3030-3539\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3539\">Covert Action<\/a>, a action spy game that was set aside in favor of Railroad Tycoon.<\/p><p>After Covert Action was finished, the team went back to Civilization where it saw the addition of its most important elements. First, the team incorporated turn based play. Zoning was abandoned and military strategy was added. Individual units were added that could be manipulated to various tasks. Meier also included the technology progression tree. During this time, little historic research was used. Instead Meier used popular conventions in how the public understood history, and incorporated these elements into his technology tree. With these additions to Civilization, the game was ready to leave the hands of Meier and Shelley.<\/p><p>Due to the low priority of Meier's games at MicroProse, they had trouble securing the help they needed. It was only grudgingly that the company allowed the art team and play testing team to work on it.<\/p><p>During this phase of development, the map was halved in size, large portions of the technology tree were removed, and units were removed.

The player must also decide where to build new cities, which city improvements or units to build, and which new advances in knowledge to take.<\/p><p>As new knowledge is acquired, new units and improvements will be available to the player. Getting ahead in the technology race is a great advantage to the player.<\/p><p>There are special city improvement in the game called Wonders of the World.

Spotting his flag flying on the nearby Cotton Island, Plok sets sail to retrieve it. Once on Cotton Island, Plok makes his way through a series of decoy flags before finally defeating the Bobbins Brothers and retrieving his family heirloom.<\/p><p>Upon his return home, Plok discovers that the theft of his Grandpappy\u2019s flag was simply for the purpose of luring him away from Akrillic so that it would be left defenseless for the Fleas to take over and raise their flags over the land in the place of Plok\u2019s. Determined to reclaim his island, Plok sets out to rid the island of the Fleas and their allies. His quest eventually takes him to the depths of the Flea Pit where he must face off against the Flea Queen in order to determine the fate of Akrillic.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2840\/509113-plok__u__00011.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-509113\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2840\/509113-plok__u__00011.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-509113\"><img alt=\"Plok engages in the game's first boss fight.\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2840\/509113-plok__u__00011.png\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2840\/509113-plok__u__00011.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"><\/a><figcaption>Plok engages in the game's first boss fight.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Plok\u2019s primary ability is that he is able to throw his arms and legs in a boomerang-like manner. This ability can be used both as an attack and to solve certain puzzles which involve Plok giving up a limb in order to activate a switch. With fewer limbs, Plok is less mobile and has less \u201cammunition\u201d to attack with. Limbs used to activate switches can be retrieved from a hanger somewhere else in the level. Plok is also able to perform a spinning high-jump (very similar to <a href=\"\/sonic-the-hedgehog\/3005-73\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-73\">Sonic the Hedgehog<\/a>\u2019s jumps) which allows him to reach platforms he can\u2019t with his weak standard jump. After receiving an amulet later in the game, the high-jump can also be used as an attack.<\/p><p>Plok proceeds from level to level via an overworld screen. The path is linear, but levels can be skipped by using warps throughout the game. Warp zones are accessed by hitting specific berries (usually just used to increase health) until they teleport Plok to the warp area. Once in the warp zone, a \u201cRace Against Time\u201d event will take place which challenges Plok to get some sort of vehicle through a special level and across the finish line in a limited amount of time. If Plok is successful, he\u2019ll be transported ahead to a later level of the game, but if he fails, he\u2019ll be spit back out in the same spot he entered the warp zone.<\/p><p>The world of Poly-Esta is filled with many different items and power-ups for Plok to collect. Shells scattered throughout each level will net him an extra life if he can get enough. They can also be used to fuel his special high-jump attack after the amulet item is received later in the game. Additionally, Plok collects the letters P-L-O-K in order to get \u201cPlokontinues\u201d which allow him to continue his journey if he loses all of his lives. Every time Plok defeats a Rockyfella, it will drop a ruby which grants Plok invincibility for a short time. The Razor Wheel pickup will transform Plok into an invincible spinning steel blade that storms through the world with incredible speed. Presents hidden in the world allow Plok to temporarily don one of many costumes that grant him special abilities.<\/p><h2>Development History<\/h2><p>The character of <a href=\"\/plok\/3005-1825\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1825\">Plok<\/a> was originally developed during the late 80\u2019s by brothers <a href=\"\/john-pickford\/3040-36037\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-36037\">John Pickford<\/a> and <a href=\"\/ste-pickford\/3040-4787\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-4787\">Ste Pickford<\/a>. The character\u2019s introduction to the public was to be as the star of a <a href=\"\/zippo-games\/3010-1634\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1634\">Zippo Games<\/a> developed coin-op game titled Fleapit, but unfortunately after the game was about half complete it was put on hold and eventually disappeared with the closing of the studio. The Pickford brothers however managed to retain the intellectual property rights to the basic game and character design. This allowed them to commence with development of another similar title that would eventually become the 1993 title Plok.<\/p><h2>Game Reception<\/h2><p>When the Pickford brothers were first developing Fleapit (the game that would become Plok) during the late 80\u2019s, the gaming landscape was ripe for an inventive, cute, colorful, character-driven platformer to come along and explode with popularity. However, during the early 90\u2019s the video game market experienced a massive flood of colorful character-driven platform titles such as <a href=\"\/bubsy-in-claws-encounters-of-the-furred-kind\/3030-20205\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20205\">Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind<\/a>, <a href=\"\/rayman\/3030-18473\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18473\">Rayman<\/a>, <a href=\"\/sonic-the-hedgehog\/3030-2465\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2465\">Sonic the Hedgehog<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/zool\/3030-8884\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8884\">Zool<\/a>. Thus, by the time Plok was finally released in 1993, it didn\u2019t seem nearly as fresh as it was when development first started nearly five years ago. Reviews for the game were overall very favorable, but commercially the game was received very poorly and sales were underwhelming. There just wasn\u2019t enough to distinguish this game from all of the others that appeared so similar. The game has also at times been criticized because of its difficulty and lack of a save or password system.<\/p><p>Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the scores of 7,8,9 and 8 with \"Sushi-X\" exclaiming, \"...Plok has got to be one of the most unique games to come out in a while.\" Ed Semrad wrote, \"...while the bosses aren't anything to write home about, the actual game is visually stunning.

It follows the adventures of young, Belgian reporter Tintin and his friends Captain Haddock and Professor Tournesol. <\/p><p>While Tintin and his friends are vacationing in a Swiss mountain resort, they get news about a plane crash in Tibet. Tintin starts having dreams of his friend Tchang, stranded in the Himalayas, calling for help.

After narrowly avoiding a lethal avalanche, they find a Buddhist monastery.

Dogi's hometown, located in the land of Felghana, had been experiencing crop failure as well as vicious nighttime attacks. Not afraid of the danger, Adol and Dogi set forth on their new adventure.<\/p><p>Ys III, like its predecessors, was originally released on the NEC PC-8801 and its upgraded version PC-9801 in 1989. It was soon ported to other Japanese home computers, like the MSX and Sharp X68000. A couple of years later, it was ported to the SNES, Genesis and TurboGrafx-CD.

There is little or no challenge here and the whole quest is too straightforward for an adventure game\".<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Ys III features several new additions to the Ys series, while also retaining several components. The most important change comes in the form of it's gameplay. No longer played from a <a href=\"\/top-down-perspective\/3015-788\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-788\">top-down perspective<\/a>, Ys III is played from a <a href=\"\/side-scrolling\/3015-299\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-299\">side-scrolling<\/a> perspective not unlike another <a href=\"\/nihon-falcom-corp\/3010-849\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-849\">Falcom<\/a>-developed title, <a href=\"\/sorcerian\/3030-2411\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2411\">Sorcerian<\/a>. With a change in perspective also comes a change in game mechanics. Players now have direct control over Adol's ability to attack, either with ducking, forward, or overhead sword attacks, which is a major departure from the previous game. In Ys I &amp; II, players had to come in contact with enemies in order to damage them, as the majority of attacks were done automatically. Only in Ys II did players have a controllable attack in the form of a fireball. Another major change is the ability to <a href=\"\/jump\/3015-379\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-379\">jump<\/a>. Since Ys III is also a platformer, the game has been given vertical depth, and as such, Adol needs the ability to jump to attack certain enemies and overcome obstacles. Yet another change to the gameplay system is the omission of magic points. Replaced by consumable rings, players can accrue a stock of them by defeating enemies, and subsequently use them to power the different permanent rings that Adol finds over the course of his adventure. Also of note, is that Ys III does not feature as much <a href=\"\/backtracking\/3015-239\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-239\">back-tracking<\/a> as it's predecessors, and is much shorter in length because of it.<\/p><p>As for the components that Ys III kept, the first would be the wearable rings. Found at various points in the game, Adol can obtain five different rings - power, shield, time, heal, and protection - that have the same properties as they did in the previous games. Adol must also buy or find the different swords, shields, and armors throughout the game, with five items per category just like the previous games. In addition to Adol's equipment, he must also find an array of items, keys, and objects to aid him in his journey and to open up new paths. Ys III also has an experience point system like the previous games, however, depending on the version played, the game will either feature diminishing <a href=\"\/experience-points\/3015-39\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience points<\/a> ( <a href=\"\/turbografx-cd\/3045-53\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-53\">TGCD<\/a>) or not ( <a href=\"\/snes\/3045-9\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES<\/a>).

One day, a curious teenage boy living in Bronco Village decides to sneak out of his house and venture out to investigate. During his expedition, a flying saucer crashes right in front of him.

The NES and the SNES versions are actually two different games.<\/p><h2>NES Version<\/h2><p>In this version the player assumes the role of James Bond Jr. In the first level Bond Jr. is tasked with finding 5 missiles in 45 minutes in an underground complex. Each time he reaches a bomb, he must disarm it via a tile mini game where the player must rearrange the tiles to match the picture the game is showing.<\/p><p>In level two, Bond Jr. must unlock 6 safes in an underground enemy base that's full of enemies and invisible doors. Once the safe has been found, the player has nine tries to find the 4 digit code that randomly changes each time they fail. The player must do all this under 25 minutes.<\/p><p>James Bond Jr. has bombs to blow up certain walls and a trusty gun to shoot bad guys with. To switch weapons the player must press the select button. Bond Jr. can also jump.<\/p><h2>SNES Version<\/h2><p>This version was in color as opposed to its NES version. It was a mix of shooting and platforming. In the first level, the player must pilot a helicopter equipped with missiles and bombs while avoiding enemy missiles and trees. The second level takes place in a Mayan temple. This level is known for being particularly frustrating as it is full of snakes and Bond can only kick or punch up and thus not hit the enemies. Bond Jr. can mesmerize the snakes with a flute or kill them with grenades.<\/p><p>The game alternates vehicle and exploration missions. Level three is another helicopter mission, level four takes place in the sewers where Bond Jr. must avoid radioactive pools, spikes and mini waves. He can pick up gadgets like a gas mask and grenades that freezes water. The level ends with a boss fight against a submarine.<\/p><p>Level 5 has Bond Jr. piloting a spaceship in a level that looks a lot like <a href=\"\/super-r-type\/3030-8479\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8479\">Super R-Type<\/a>. In level 6, he arrives at the enemy's space base where he must avoid turrets and other other such obstacles. He must then defeat the final boss and the game ends like this:<\/p><p>\"You'll pay for this James Bond Jr.!\", to which Bond answers, \"No problem, scum lord!

His spirit passes<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3699\/390641-79729_17_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-390641\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 242px\" data-ratio=\"0.66528925619835\" data-width=\"242\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3699\/390641-79729_17_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-390641\"><img alt=\"A regular random encounter\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px\" data-width=\"242\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3699\/390641-79729_17_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3699\/390641-79729_17_2.jpg 242w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A regular random encounter\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3699\/390641-79729_17_2.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3699\/390641-79729_17_2.jpg 242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px\" data-width=\"242\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A regular random encounter<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>on his power to Krile, who joins our warriors, now out to get Exdeath once and for all.<\/p><p>The group heads straight for Exdeath's castle, climb up, and face him in battle. They defeat him, but it is too late. Exdeath accomplishes his goal, and two worlds - Bartz's world and Glauf's - fuse together. The group once again seeks Ghido's counsel, and he advises they collect all of the legendary weapons. The group travels far and wide, breaking the seals on the weapons, and taking each one. Once this task is completed, they head for the rift. They meet Gilgamesh one final time, who gives them his friendship. They go further into the rift, where Exdeath has gained the power of the void, and reveals his true form: a monstrous tree. He shows his true form, Neo Exdeath, and the final battle begins.<\/p><h2>Jobs<\/h2><p>The main gameplay feature that Final Fantasy V is remembered for is its open-ended \"Job\" system. Unlike most games in the series, each character can be assigned to perform any role the player desires, whether that be <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3518\" href=\"\/spellcaster\/3015-3518\/\">spellcaster<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-135\" href=\"\/dual-wielding\/3015-135\/\">dual-wielding<\/a> ninja, or hard to kill knight. At the start of the game, six classes, some based on classic Final Fantasy archetypes ( <a data-ref-id=\"3015-211\" href=\"\/hume-black-mage\/3015-211\/\">Black Mage<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-212\" href=\"\/hume-white-mage\/3015-212\/\">White Mage<\/a>, Thief) are given to the player, and a total of 22 are gradually unlocked over the course of the game. Each of these Jobs comes with various advantages and disadvantages; spellcasters are typically weaker, but their ability to cast magic can make them very useful, while classes such as Thief are more adept at subtle advantages (like stealing from enemies) rather than sheer damage dealing.<\/p><p>As characters gain the traditional experience levels, they also gain AP, which serve as a sort of \"Job experience point\" system. As a character levels up their experience in a Job, they unlock various abilities that can then be used while the character is using another class, an example being casting Black Magic while the character is a White Mage, thereby allowing one character to serve both offensive and defensive roles. Characters are limited as to how many abilities they can have equipped at once, however, requiring strategic choices by the player to get past different points in the game.<\/p><p>A few of the character types introduced in Final Fantasy V have become staple elements of future games. The <a data-ref-id=\"3015-775\" href=\"\/hume-blue-mage\/3015-775\/\">Blue Mage<\/a> is the most prominent, with his ability to learn attacks that enemies have used on him being present in just about every game in the series since, and the concept of Time Mage has lived on in most games since, providing a category for spells like Slow and Haste which were previously placed with Black and White Magic, respectively.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1759763-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1759763\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 225px\" data-ratio=\"0.96444444444444\" data-width=\"225\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:96.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1759763-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1759763\"><img alt=\"Main characters as white mages\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-width=\"225\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1759763-1.png\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1759763-1.png 225w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Main characters as white mages\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1759763-1.png\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1759763-1.png 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-width=\"225\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Main characters as white mages<\/figcaption><\/figure><ul><li>Knight<\/li><li>Monk<\/li><li>Thief<\/li><li>Lancer<\/li><li>Ninja<\/li><li>Samurai<\/li><li>Berserker<\/li><li>Sorcerer<\/li><li>White Mage<\/li><li>Black Mage<\/li><li>Time Mage<\/li><li>Summoner<\/li><li>Blue Mage<\/li><li>Red Mage<\/li><li>Trainer<\/li><li>Chemist<\/li><li>Geomancer<\/li><li>Bard<\/li><li>Dancer<\/li><li>Mime<\/li><\/ul><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><p>Disc 1<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1759764-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1759764\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 588px\" data-ratio=\"0.85034013605442\" data-width=\"588\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:85.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1759764-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1759764\"><img alt=\"Soundtrack cover art\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4527\/1759764-1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1759764-1.jpg 588w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4527\/1759764-1.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4527\/1759764-1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Soundtrack cover art\" src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4527\/1759764-1.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1759764-1.jpg 588w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4527\/1759764-1.jpg 480w, http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4527\/1759764-1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Soundtrack cover art<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>1.
